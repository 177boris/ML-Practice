 Would have appreciated a shop in the hotel that sold drinking water etc but not necessity Would recommend if like us you arrive late at night to bring drinks from plane airport as there s no shop nearby There is a minibar though if you want to pay those prices ,0
 Pillows ,0
 They don t have free wifi,0
 Room generally a bit shabby with some lack of maintenance Some crumbs on bedroom floor these issues did not spoil our minibreak It would be nice to have vegetarian sausages available for breakfast ,0
 Executive rooms 9th Floor don t have a bath Their website made it look like all rooms did have one and when being at the end of a hall there s no wifi connection possible Mind that during my first two stays here I did have a perfect wifi connection ,0
 Pity about the two days of rain,0
 Didn t like it at all construction was in progress stuff lied to us about vacancy ,0
 N A,0
 Pool was very small and kind of chemical too much chlorine,0
 In the room they gave us first wi fi signal was very low When we pointed out that the staff immediatly proposed us to change room in order to have a better internet service So we really appreciated their availability However they could work to improve the wi fi system all around the building ,0
 Breakfast was okay Typical European but did start at 6am which was good as we had an early flight out ,0
 1 Bed was faulty seemed to dip in the middle very uncomfortable 2 VERY noisy room so got very little sleep because of 1 and 2 3 Make up mirror faulty 4 Cleaning disturbing me when I m trying to get ready for work 5 Concierge whose response was oh dear i was not impressed ,0
 Very noisy room close to an extrrnal electricity cell buzzing loud all the time air conditioning with poor control cheap fixtures very small room poor value for the money spent quite a lot ,0
 Room rate a bit expensive Breakfast included in the room rate is very basic Need to pay more attention to room cleaning,0
 I wouldn t say it was a 5 star hotel but a very good 4 Star,0
 The air conditioning failed on one night however there was no issue in changing rooms If anything i know its Paris and rooms are small by nature but it did feel a bit cramped ,0
 There wasn t anything to dislike ,0
 The location was very close to the Tower of London and the Thames but during the weekend the area is too calm and quiet far away from shops and places of interest ,0
 rooms need more lights,0
 Very expensive parking When we booked a 3 adult room we were squeezed to a 2 people room where the extra bed barely fit the booking details were very misleading Had to complain and argue with the staff to finally get upgraded All and all painful experience ,0
 The street is quiet for the neighbourhood but Soho does have a nightlife If you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room I slept just fine ,0
 Construction site next door meant it was a bit noisy in our room first thing Railway close by too so added noise but not unbearable ,0
 Shower a little tired now The shower curtain didn t prevent the water from running out of the bath and all over the floor ,0
 Bad Storm could not get back to Hotel trams stopped trees on power lines,0
 Room is a little too minimalistic for my taste but overall was fine There was kind of a weird smell in my room like the carpet was recently shampooed with something strong ,0
 Pillows are a bit too soft but bed is awesome ,0
 All are excellent,0
 The room was tiny no bigger than a box room in a terraced house bed was pushed up against 2 walls my wife and I couldn t get changed at the same time because the room didn t have enough space to allow us to ,0
 No view of sunlight from the bedroom as it looked in a well and faced other rooms which meant no privacy Also a long walk around the hallways to get to the room,0
 Room service menu is somewhat limited and quite costly The excellent bar has a poor selection of beers and Scotch whiskies this should be simple to fix The cost of drinks in the bar is higher than usual for hotels in this range ,0
 Very dark everywhere rooms corridors Felt that 2 slices of toast and a coffee for 10 overpriced even by London standards No bar and not allowed to eat or drink outside in terraced area even though pretty secluded ,0
 A new member of staff in the restaurant Even though I told her that I hadn t prepaid for breakfast but that I had pre authorised funds for payment on my room number I asked her to bill my breakfast to my room She later stopped me leaving the restaurant and told me I had to pay Very embarrassing as I had earlier told her to bill it to my room Which she then proceeded to do The same member of staff served me the evening before in the bar She couldn t work the till and then gave me the wrong change too much Thankfully Rugby fans are generally honest folk ,0
 The hallways were a little shabby but the hotel is clearly going through refurbishment so I m sure this shall be addressed soon,0
 Hotel need some renovation ,0
 Little bit further out of the city centre but there s an underground station about 5 mins away and you can catch a hop on hop off bus right outside the hotel,0
 The room was old and the pictures i saw online for the room was completly different to reality ,0
 Parking was expensive ,0
 It was a shame that the bar area was being refurbished at the time of our stay,0
 Gym small currently some building works outside property,0
 The breakfast was not as varied as I hoped,0
 Breakfast provision fine though hot drinks a bit hard work Ok for evening meal but not great Not much atmosphere ,0
 Decor,0
 Wordings of minutes from Tube station was deceiving Lodge was located much further took a half hour walk each way Few buses run through the area hence was really inconvenient Pricey for that location and facilities Early check in was promised when requested on Bookin com but asked to pay extra when we arrived Very dishonest we felt So was overall an unpleasant experience ,0
 Staff could have been better long check out lines waueted ages on tea coffee at breakfast on day 1 entrance way was dirty,0
 Wi fi could ve been made complimentary since it was too slow for 10 Euros ,0
 Defenetely need a refurbishment ,0
 Due to the location and it being a very touristy area we had heard that pickpocketing was very common in that area We didn t experience this ourselves however ,0
 Bed a bit hard for us,0
 Check in seemed unnecessarily time consuming leading to queues Took 25 mins between arriving at hotel and getting to room ,0
 Room quite small at front of hotel and at times quite noisey ,0
 Only one person was at the reception had to wait around 8 11mins to be spoken to location is the middle of a dual carriage ,0
 9 50 for a Bailey s seems a little pricey ,0
 Semi transparent wall of bathroom It cause uncomfortable when you travel with friends,0
 This Four Seasons does NOT compare to the other Four Seasons we ve stayed at It s almost like it s a lower end franchise of the real Four Seasons Furnishings and overall accommodations and services are well below par as compared to other Four Seasons ,0
 I would have loved to have a room facing the Eiffel tower,0
 The lobby is kind of small and the reception counter is always busy ,0
 Basement room is totally affected by the smells of the surroundings ktichens and services located in the building ,0
 Laundry is very expensive and wifi is not free,0
 Small rooms,0
 The size of the swimming pool it was more of a plunge pool ,0
 Rude staff on arrival Our room was not ready on arrival at 8pm even though we were able to check in from 3pm ,0
 Air conditioning in the room is not powerful enough and the room gets very hot during a hot day over 25 C ,0
 Cleaners perhaps need to pay a little more attention to detail,0
 The bed lost its firmness in the middle a new one makes this room perfect ,0
 Wish the rooms were not so tiny ,0
 15 mins walk to the nearest metro,0
 Same breakfast everyday,0
 Loved it all,0
 No Scrambled Eggs or Bacon at breakfast ,0
 Outdated hotel and rooms not all personnel speaks English fluently Once my room smell like cigarettes after cleaning,0
 I couldn t find the hotel using my sat nav If i typed the postcode i ended up somewhere else close by but no outside the hotel Took us a while to find the hotel ,0
 felt a bit pressurised by housekeepers to vacate by 11 Sunday ,0
 More electrical outlets and a mirror around one of the outlets eg for use with the hairdryer,0
 The reception clerks English was too Bad to understand My room was bed only I was asked if I want breakfast so I said tomorrow yes the day after I l see so I was asked for my credit card and was informed that they want a 30 pound deposit and when I leave I will get Mack any money still due This never happened to me in any hotel in the world Especially as I showed my Priotity holiday card When I asked for a newspaper I was told tha I can only get the independent free any other I will be charged The room was small and there was no easy chair so I could relax I spoke to the duty manager and complained He promised to give me better service when I return This I m writing to you for your sake and others that will come here ,0
 The staff That is the most important thing in a hotel or at least in a luxury hotel I m still waiting for something I asked them They said they will call me back and I m still waiting,0
 Photos didn t match the room that I had,0
 Staf,0
 Good be in a better maintenance ,0
 Small elevator only but not a big deal,0
 Not so clean rooms we had aunts in the room not so clean bathroom very small space for bathroom separated from the shower and bathtub no ventilation very user furniture The so called free wifi is not working in the room only at the reception ,0
 At breakfast the staff wouldn t let me move a small table so I could sit with my colleagues Fresh fruit salad would have been nice instead of tinned fruit ,0
 Noticed the cups in my bathroom had not been changed making me question how thoroughly the room had been cleaned ,0
 The bed was a little uncomfortable for me but my wife liked it just fine ,0
 I did request a high level room with amazing views as I have stayed there before but the room was low level with lots of road noise and a very very large mechanical crain outside our window,0
 The cleaning of the rooms was problematic We were away from the room until 16 00 and the room was not cleaned until then and after they would clean around 17 00 so if you were at the room at the time you would miss the cleaning service for a day If they did clean always forgot to add the paper and the amenities The Indian receptionist was not friendly at all at the limit of being rude ,0
 The rooms are a little dated However the price is a great value You have lovely staff and great space ,0
 The hotel is dated the condition of the common areas is poor The carpet are worn stained and dirty The carpet in the rooms are in a similar condition On the day night of my stay there was no hot water and no effort was made to inform guest of this problem The air conditioning unit in my room was not working and requires a service I have stayed in the hotel on a number of occasions over the past 24 months I have noticed a gradual detrrioration of the rooms and common areas over this time It is not value for money any more ,0
 there is no iron in the room and when I called they said no we don t put iron in the room for safty purposes we iron it and its charged where other hotels they have in the room and its free ,0
 No parking on location A bit of a walk but not to bad Hotel is only on top 2 floors of the building kind of threw us off Great hotel can t complain Maybe a tad pricey but it s in the capital ,0
 5 charge to deliver room service AND limited choice after 11pm We would have liked cheese biscuits but it wasn t available after 11pm but cooked items were It didn t seem to make sense ,0
 Restaurant food not tasty ,0
 Non functional ac,0
 The Liverpool Fans just joking ,0
 The breakfast is overpriced I understand that 4 5 star hotels usually have a pricier buffet however there weren t many options available Also you can notice the hotel has received a facelift the decor is not fantastic ,0
 the workers who work in the dining place are not that kind ,0
 For us was far for the centre but well connected with public transport,0
 paper thin walls prefab Can hear everything happening in the rooms next door ,0
 Breakfast plenty of choice but the fruit was tinned and the pantry range was not of the best quality The bedroom was very hot but luckily we could open a window,0
 room was small with hardly any space to hang clothes,0
 Local restaurants a bit limited but many more only a couple of metro stops away ,0
 Staff at the breakfast buffet,0
 The bed was a bit too hard for me I think there was perfume in the air conditioning or used in the room cleaning I have perfume allergy and I did not like the perfume smell in the bedroom But I was able to open the window so that helped The dining room did not open until 7 30pm so I had to wait from 6pm and I was hungry The food prices are not cheap but its similar to other hotels much cheaper to eat outside the hotel,0
 Room was very small We were expecting small but this was even smaller than that Not too much of a problem as we were out and about most of the time ,0
 This hotel is shocking the staff can t speak a word of English and when order room service last night they sent me up cold chilli without no rice after waiting over a 1 hour and then spoke to the duty manager John who said he would refund me the full amount of 10 24 which was find but when I check this morning the hotel not given me a refund they have taken out 17 50 what a jock I want a full refund for the 17 50 please the stay off 199 00 because the service was shocking,0
 The air conditioning did not work well in the first room we were assigned to As well as not cooling effectively the fan was directly above the head of the bed making it very noisy After our first night we were moved to an outside room on the back of the hotel where the air conditioned worked better and the fan was further away from the bed Also the interior room did not have an outside window so it felt very confining ,0
 Staff are not friendly,0
 Breakfast uncomfy bed puzzled staff,0
 Restricted space in the night club on the top floor even for hotel guests was not appreciated,0
 Very dirty with fungus on the ceiling in the bathroom ,0
 I booked via booking com and specified that I would like to pay via cash on check out which I was told would be fine at the hotel However on check out the payment was taken from my card nonetheless I had left my card details as security ,0
 The shower and spa area,0
 The card to open the door didn t work three different times,0
 Edges along landing and furniture very dusty housekeeping could be better,0
 our room was too hot the hotel switched into winter schedule and turned off the air conditioner That s the answer I got after complaining about the room temperature They told me to open the window ,0
 Not enough cartons of milk in the room to use with the nespresso machine and a room service charge of over 3 if you ask for more ,0
 The free upgrade was amazing however I would of been super happy with the perfect London view from our room instead Just me been awkward ,0
 Air con in room could be better Also nobody answered when calling for room service numerous times ,0
 toilet seat in the bathroom squashed in a very tight corner not comfortable ,0
 The fire alarm kept going off and I could not use the bathroom because it was too small,0
 Confusion over rate change by receptionist however supervisor quickly and efficiently dealt with the problem ,0
 No room service,0
 The staff is absolutely unfriendly They are so cold that it makes you feel embarrassed in any interaction all the time The friendly ones always seem to be overloaded with the work to be done We ve ordered two glasses of Cava in the swimming pool and half hour later we needed to cancel the order as they haven t been served Although the hotel is classified as a 5 stars GL this doesn t reflect the reality there s an aim of looking like sumptuous and definitely there s beauty everywhere but they are so far away of providing high levels of service that I do NOT recommend it at all I know Barcelona by heart and there are plenty of much much better staying options ,0
 One of the worst places we have ever stayed for sure I have travelled all around the world but this place for sure deserves to be entitled campsite They are under staffed and over loaded You ask for some ice and get charged 5 Euros even for delivering food to your room they charged you 5 They don t change the bedsheets and pillow case assuming that you would not find out They just turn them around and use the same dirty sheets The location of the hotel is awfull where you seriously fear for your life if you want to go out after 8 pm Even taxi drivers refuse to drop you off there Honestly there is no management at all Btw your breakfast was awful and the same Sh every day I will never ever stay at your awful place again and not even recommend your campsite to my enemies For the people from some countries your campsite may look alright but let s face it you are not even close to being fine ,0
 All good,0
 The wifi wasn t too great unfortunately ,0
 Really small room Almost like an attic ,0
 Every aspect of our stay was good or better ,0
 Breakfast seemed very expensive so we opted not to take it in hotel,0
 Rooms were not allocated correctly,0
 Rooms were no where near the standard of the lobby which was disappointing ,0
 Mattress very firm,0
 Sky bar drinks are expensive that s all I can say But it s London so can t really say much ,0
 maybe shuttle bus transfer for ppl with extra luggages,0
 Parking should be free,0
 Very hot even with open window near a boiler maybe room 207 AC did not work Hole in the ceiling above the shower a bit unnerving 2x single beds connected instead of full bed ,0
 Rips on edges of duvet cover no big light in room side lamp didn t work Surface crack in sink,0
 The bathroom door was a modern sliding glass door which didn t make the bathroom as private as it could have been ,0
 Pretty happy really ,0
 Small rooms,0
 The room was small and the bathroom was tiny ,0
 price,0
 Poor lighting for applying makeup,0
 My baby with me ,0
 Breakfast was a bit grim cold not very well presented The single room was very single ,0
 Can t think of anything,0
 Bar snacks x dreadful and extortionate,0
 Poor Wifi Old mattress The Shower was clogged ,0
 The room was dusty in places and the glasses were dirty the shower water went everywhere which was dangerous for me and my partner The view was a disappointment considering the amount of money I paid for the reservation room The reason I booked the hotel was for the view advertised on the website Very unsatified with my stay I ve stayed in Cardiff park plaza and it was unbelievablely clean and worth the money ,0
 Water only just lukewarm not hot enough for bath shower Took payment in advance when should have been pay on arrival,0
 Elevator only goes to 3rd floor No luggage to room service on arrival Shower head was old and splashed a bit Breakfast was a bit small,0
 Didn t think that the buffet breakfast was that good for the cost,0
 Our double room with two double beds although comfortable enough for 3 of us was rather too small when taking into account the large occasional table and armchair sqeezed in between the bed and the window The furniture and the room itself looked rather tired and dated and could do with an up date ,0
 restaurant was only for breakfast and very expensive,0
 a Most receptionists never acknowledged guests on their way in and out but kept head low or on computer screen Eye contact and greetings make a difference b I would add some pastries for breakfast like croissants ,0
 Staff was unfriendly,0
 The room was cold and the bathroom heater was broken No refund or discount when asked They offered other rooms but they were no better and colder ,0
 Poor Wifi connection No more than one device can be connected Frequent dropping of signals Room Fridge was not cooling at all ,0
 Small room ,0
 The chef was terrible disgusting food Although set ok was beautiful Wasted 62 50 on the worst cuisine ever Other than that I can t complain much however I thought the staff were not informative enough No one came and told us about any events and where to go Staff could have been talkative and more approachable Seemed stuck up girls to be honest ,0
 Shower was terrible Hairdryer in room did not work ,0
 The rooms were rather warm and the air conditioning was difficult to adjust as the windows were locked this made it a bit tricky to sleep well ,0
 No parking available at this hotel however another hotel just a five minute walk away did offer paid parking ,0
 1 Too small breakfast area overcrowded nonstop during the breakfast time 2 Poor breakfast eg cucumbers felt as if they were frozen prior to being served no fish no fresh juices 3 No slippers in rooms 4 Asked to clean my room twice they didn t but brought new towels 5 Quite far from the city centre ,0
 Check in process was poor A long wait while one agent dealt with a concierge style request and the other answered the phone The room was very poorly lit with no light at all over the desk or make up table ,0
 All good ,0
 We had initially booked a classic bedroom but only to find out when we arrived that the room was very very small for even 2 people too pricey for classic bedrooom We had to pay extra to upgrade for a superior room of a decent size If I had known the size of the classic bedroom I wouldn t have booked it at all The photos of the classic bedroom you find here is not realistic I was really disappointed The other issue was the hotel is undergoing renovation and we weren t informed about this There is no breakfast room available Our total price for the 3 nights stay was 700 Euros which is too pricey for this hotel ,0
 Swimming pool was cold Breakfast could have had more variety Bedroom was on the small side,0
 Loved everything,0
 Room service,0
 The tiles in the shower had been painted over and it was peeling extensively which looked horrible There was also a shower over the bath which was up to the standard of the rest of the room ,0
 Paying for Wi Fi Outside Windows still need cleaning this detracts from some stunning views,0
 Air conditioning did not work and hot in the room,0
 In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault ,0
 Room on the smaller side,0
 Breakfast could use more variety Our superior double room opens to the terrace which was a slight discomfort in this cold weather ,0
 Almost no shopping possibility in and around ,0
 Parking charges could be a bit reasonable,0
 The Shower needed updating but adequate enough,0
 Expensive bar,0
 My room had a door to the adjacent room which was not properly soundproofed So when a next door visitor started to speak over the telephone at 5 AM I could literally hear every word ,0
 The last day elevator was not working I had to carry my suite case from 6th floor ,0
 swipe cards were occasionally faulty and had to be replaced twice,0
 Blanlets pillows were heavily smelling medicine odor We claimed but new blankets pillows were given a day after we had to suffer one night as there was no other room available blankets pillows can not be changed with clean ones as room service was closed after 8pm ,0
 The hotel does not yet seem to have the right facilities to offer good food via room service so best is to find a restaurant nearby if you want a meal ,0
 Actually for once I though cooked breakfast was pretty poor Sloppy scrambled eggs sausage not nice wife s bacon very fatty Really wasn t very nice First time and I ve stayed there a few times ,0
 The breakfast and room service menus need to be modernised with more healthy options,0
 TV programmes did not include any russian channel ,0
 We had problem with the room phone and requested the hotel staff to come and fix it until we checked out after 5 days the phone was not fixed ,0
 I feel the room could have been cleaner in places,0
 The location is not fantastic a bit in the middle of nowhere but then the price and the hotel quality makes up for it so I would stay again at the right price Most days it was not a big problem there was a taxi outside which costs around 10 euros to get to the centre but on Saturday night there was not one in the vicinity apparently there are less taxis working on weekends Ended up walking to the tube which took about 15 through dark and slightly shabby roads Taxi took around 15 25 mins depending on traffic The bar closes early at 11 30 pm and there is nowhere else nearby ,0
 Slight noise form the Metro that seems to run underneath the Hotel almost continual rumble starting from about 05 00 It s not too intrusive but did wake me a couple of times It would not put me off from staying again though ,0
 Poor noise insulation very loud from other hotel rooms and from the street We were moved to a higher floor after complaining where it was slightly better Breakfast was rather lacking the pancakes were not good and fruit low quality ,0
 Didn find ,0
 If I was being really the lighting in the main bedroom was either high level and too bright or low level and too dull I would like fresh milk in the room ,0
 Bathroom didn t have much counter space but worked around it,0
 Quite expensive ,0
 On one day we went out in the morning and came back around 4pm and our room was still not cleaned We had to leave for 30min for cleaning The following day we didn t get clean cups which was really disappointing as we enjoy a cup of tea or two every night Other than that the hotel is very clean just a few missing finer details ,0
 The room was small No shower cap in the bath ,0
 The shower temperature was a little awkward to control and maintain The mattress on the double bed was smaller than the base and seemed to be not quite double sized ,0
 No faults found ,0
 My room had a really strong smell of polish that wouldn t go away and hairs in the bath,0
 Size of the room Slightly small than expected ,0
 Tiny tiny issue as most of the room was spotless there was a little dust in a few areas of the room and the bath tub had a stray hair I cant say the room wasn t cleaned as it was evidently done but a little attention to detail would have made this visit perfect ,0
 Food bricfast poor,0
 Breakfast on the Sunday morning as we had to wait over 20 mins for a table they had a wedding party in the day before and all their rooms were full and they could not handle a full hotel they should have opened the room up for breakfast that they had the wedding in,0
 In the past if I ve booked a docklands hotel it s usually walking distance from Canary Wharf I booked this hotel in error this hotel should be titled Hilton Surrey quays not Hilton docklands as this was misleading Our taxi driver which cost us a fortune as the boat was on a break said a lot of people make the same mistake On arrival the reception had no record of our booking luckily I had my paperwork and email on me however they had no record of me bringing my children even though I remember I had to input their ages when I made the booking To be fair the hotel rectified this and put my husband kids and I in a very spacious 2 bedroom suite My parents however mum was celebrating her 60th birthday were put in a tiny room overlooking the carpark and was kept awake till 3am with crowds leaving the hotel and car doors slamming Lesson learnt Read the address of this hotel don t just look at the title and assume ,0
 Air conditioning wasn t very good Couldn t get stereo to work ,0
 Staff not always at reception and had to wait a while to be seen ,0
 Size of rooms is small The cloth closet is not enough,0
 They didn t serve alcohol as they didn t have a licence we were not told previously and on our last day the restaurant closed for no reason ,0
 The carpets in the passages were old and decrepid Staff were nice and helpful,0
 No taxis pass by The price was a little high considering the location The room was very nice but the furniture was a little scuffed the desk notably ,0
 Service cleaning enter in the room I ask for a late check out they told me yes and they start to call every 15 minutes to leave the room Breakfast they don t permitted to take a breakfast and finish in the room The internet is not the best People form the reception are not so friendly and they have problem to talk in english ,0
 The ground floor room G5 was pokey and oddly shaped and facing on to Gower St at ground level it was really noisy The UCL Hospital is just up the road and while it is comforting to be close to such a centre of excellence the noise and frequency of emergency ambulances going past was a bummer ,0
 My only issue with the hotel was that the rooms windows are kept locked under key due to safety laws so it s understandable and if you want them opened closed you have to contact somebody at the reception each time Also the trams outside are very easy to be heard from inside the rooms,0
 Facility was going through a renovation which was not announced during the time of booking otherwise I might have gone elsewhere The place was a bit noisy due to the renovation Plumbing was old but functional The bathroom sink had separate hot and cold faucets Made it difficult to wash your face without having to fill the sink Some lights in the room did not work Very limited room service menu,0
 The room was not being cleaned according to our expectations The cups were not washed and left in the sink and the next day we were given a broken cup ,0
 Breakfast the corridors to rooms were dark and dingy Bathrooms old and in need of revamp,0
 Breakfast a little bit basic ,0
 Rooms a little small,0
 The rooms are quite small ,0
 Basically the hotel is a set of residential apartments within a residential block altered to be Hotel rooms The only shared accommodation is a check in and small breakfast area two floors above Rooms are small and not ones that you would spend any time in Seemed expensive for what we got but I guess all Hotels in Amsterdam are expensive No bikes available for hire but a hire shop just down the road ,0
 The food was very poor we had to send it back twice it was awful,0
 small missunderstanding with stuff but at the end everything turn out OK,0
 AC was a bit hard to set room was sometimes cold but not really important ,0
 Rooms are quite small for more than 1 person Also rooms in higher category do not offer more space that the standard room ,0
 Bed was very hard but that s just my opinion some people probably thought it was ok,0
 adjoining room door in room locked was noisy felt like they were in the room,0
 Priset,0
 There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,0
 No negatives ,0
 Lifts were very slow to come especially at peak times and there were queues for breakfast and checkout ,0
 Expensive for what it is some tiles damaged in the bathroom and the room is just big enough to have the double bed in it The channels on the tv are wrong not in the normal order like you are aboard trying to watch tv ,0
 Upon arrival bathroom floor was full of long hairs so room had not been checked properly by housekeeper,0
 having to climb up 4 flights of stairsconvenient,0
 Room service didn t clean my room tow days,0
 The shower did not drain properly and the bathroom floor would be completely wet after taking a shower The shower door seal was faulty ,0
 Ice machine on the corridor was not working Like all the meals I had anywhere in Barcelona the food was quite salty,0
 one day of our stay in the hotel the house keeping didnt clean our room but over all every thing was perfact,0
 The concierge did not book the taxi we asked for so we missed the start of our show on the West end The staff at breakfast were hopeless so we ate breakfast out of the hotel on our second morning ,0
 The restaurant restaurant staff food service time and limited menu does not fit with hotel s general quality ,0
 Mark on bottom sheet single beds pushed together other wise very good thought it was over priced but the pound is not doing well against the euro great staff very helpful,0
 The room was so tiny was hard to open the door if you wanted to open the bathroom door Barely enough room for one piece of luggage on the floor Not sure how this is a 4 star ,0
 It s a bit noisy but that s due to where it is close to bars late night shops etc Didn t bother me but it s something to be aware of ,0
 small rooms,0
 I did not like all the little add on charges and thought the breakfast option at 13 95 each plus an extra 2 if you had not already pre booked even if you wanted to pay cash was excessive Quote the rooms do not have awful coffee sachets but there is a constant supply of fresh coffee in the canteen coffee in sachets in the room is free Coffee in the canteen is not ,0
 There aren t many restaurants and bars nearby although it s only a relatively short walk to La Ramblas and the centre of Barcelona The tables at the buffet breakfast were a little slow in being cleared up by the staff so clean cutlery was in short supply on the morning of our breakfast Overall though I found this hotel excellent,0
 The reception wasn t anything I was expecting would have been nice if it was modern Just little out dated Also the wifi was very slow didn t seem to work very well ,0
 The room view of scaffolding,0
 The green light on the fire alarm,0
 I couldn t get hotel Wi Fi to connect with my laptop and had to use my cellphone for a hot spot Could be my technical problem Very limited availability of restaurants You You need to go to City Center,0
 The weather ,0
 The first night the fire alarm woke me up at 2 and 5 am because of someone smoking the second day they forgot to wake me up and I nearly missed the eurostar,0
 location just a bit out of historic centre of Vienna,0
 Room on small side though we were warned of this But good use of space good bathroom But overpriced despite good location,0
 Room a bit dark,0
 Stairs as an option to only ONE elevator Hotel rooms are on top floor ,0
 Most uncomfortable night ever spent in hotel bed and pillows so hard Room was tiny not worth the price paid Room very noisy you definitely knew when a tube was going underneath,0
 The rooms furnishings and general state of the hotel were all very tired and old fashioned Horrible scratchy toilet paper ,0
 Room was noisy draft coming in from windows heating did not work only a small radiator tv did not work in bathroom li complained the manager came up but could not fix it he then phoned us to say he had left a message with maintenance and if I wanted he would bring us extra covers that was last we heard wanted to speak to a manager in the morning but no manager there what a set up it put a downer on a fantastic day,0
 My booking was cancelled And I was shown a room with no window and mould round the skylight I thought about my health and ask for another room to be provided I also advise the staff that no one should occupy the room until the mould probably is addressed,0
 Unacceptable service and inconsiderate staff,0
 Our original room was not up to scratch very smoky smelling and tired d cor,0
 No complaints very professional establishment ,0
 Not enough choice on the room service menu ,0
 Room was small and over crowded by big old wooden furniture ,0
 Room was very small and pricey ,0
 The shower doesnt have the ability to keep water in prepare extra towels for a slightly wet floor ,0
 building work workmen working outside the bedroom window on scaffolding 2nd floor had to keep curtains closed at all times for privacy,0
 Our room didn t get cleaned on onne of the days during our stay informed staff and they confirmed they were busy Works going on during our stay but didn t inform us until we entered our room via letter ,0
 the breakfast Buffett was very small it s better to call it snack buffett ,0
 No subway stations close from hotel Just overground ,0
 The room was very small and cramped ,0
 The breakfast was very poor the bacon very hard and overcooked or been kept hot for too long the scrambled egg was tasteless and the porridge was watery,0
 The room was lovely but the bed was so hard both myself and my husband had no sleep and chronic backache the next day ,0
 Price,0
 Room had a big desk which made the rest of if cramped blinking lights in the room at night annoying couldn t open windows,0
 towels,0
 The room service food wasn t as good as i d hoped Pizza base seemed frozen rather than made fresh Breakfast wasn t included More cocktail choice in the rooftop bar ,0
 Some of the staff were really unskilled and obviously not capable to work in a 5 hotel Big headache to get from the ground floor to the towers section changing elevators going through doors and quite a lot of walking ,0
 Pricing is very high particularly for early Spring ,0
 The taxi company that this hotel use are disgusting We had the phone out down on us 6 times Arrogant staff and we was left stranded Hotel don t seem to care but carry on using them Staff aren t that helpful as they are so busy We queued to check in 30 minutes No mention of breakfast or anything ,0
 We had a junior suite with kitchenette Utensils were supplied only on request which was fine but comprised a pretty miserable minimal set ,0
 Not very good shower ,0
 At shower the water isn t drowning and all the bathroom was full of water on the floor ,0
 That woman at desk My husband is diabetic and insulin dependent and needs a refrigerator for his medicine and necessary food otherwise he will die so it s not frivolous We were guaranteed the fridge when we booked 5 months prior but the lady was rude and said there is no fridge and acted as if it was not a necessity We book a week in Aug Sept every year and we have been loyal since we have always been guaranteed a fridge Otherwise we d book elsewhere She said we wouldn t get one and made it seem impossible so I asked for the manager who was actually lovely and got us our fridge Next time I d appreciate some yes we can attitude from the front desk instead of making us feel as if it s a lot to request for someone with a life threatening disease PS the carpet in our room was filthy Wasn t in the new section of hotel ,0
 Small rooms a few faults in room,0
 A bottle of water in the room would be desirable,0
 The place missed the bar experience and the set up is slightly impersonal ,0
 Menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to Gafunkals Cafe 2 min walk was a great alternative ,0
 The milk provided in the fridge had gone off however was replaced straight away The aircon heating system was clicking all night which prevented my husband sleeping ,0
 Checkout was slow when I left Hotel has one reception desk and the customer ahead of me took ages to be served Corridor in the morning was quite loud as I was distrubed by people slaming doors and loud talking shouting Whilst the rooms and reception are very well maintained the corridors leading to the rooms are probably in need of some cosmeric redecoration at least the floor I was on floor 3 None of these criticisms however would put me of staying again which I will soon ,0
 The goons are kind of small but it was perfect for us,0
 We loved everything ,0
 Bar menu was limited,0
 No failings,0
 It was a little tired but clean ie Cracked bath and stained carpets The wifi was poor so had to use the hotels wifi very expensive 5 euro p h ,0
 The room was advertised as a small double and it was truly small ,0
 We specifically asked for a 12 noon book in Confirmed by Booking com We arrived at noon and were told we could not book until 3pm They blamed Booking com Who is to blame ,0
 N a,0
 Building works while there,0
 The staff serving breakfast did not speak English so it was difficult to get allergen free food ,0
 There were a lot of stairs to get to our room at the end of the day although this was offset by being in an very old and lovely building ,0
 No major things,0
 Breakfast was bio and fresh but no eggs cheese was not great 1 choice only and cakes were dried Breakfast wa ok but not great ,0
 Didn t end up with the original hotel we booked and we were meant to have deluxe rooms Which we didn t have,0
 Not child friendly nowhere to get coffees at night staff couldn t be bothered to serve us had meal in oblix staff rushed us so they could have the table back,0
 One small comment I would have loved to be able to make a warm drink in the bedroom during the early hours On my next visit I must make a note to enquire about this ,0
 Despite the stars our room was not very clean staining on the carpet missing bathroom stuff few towels no shower caps tissue not replaced room cleaning staff loudly chatting early in the morning Booked a superior room and being asked to pay additional rate for view Breakfast too expensive therefore has it outside the hotel ,0
 Hard to keep window open Breakfast minimalistic ,0
 None,0
 Tiny room,0
 Small room,0
 The shower was very small so it wasn t comfortable The hotel is quite old with outdated decore ,0
 That my stay was short,0
 Breakfast if not included is overpriced for what you get ,0
 Difficult to control the temperature directly from the room ,0
 personal opinion the pillows are quite high for me,0
 The rooms while well decorated weren t big enough for a couple like we were in a single room but they out a double bed in it Don t bother booking the romantic package a welcome package and a special bed was specified My girlfriend was arriving before me so I made sure I got that so there would be some cava and chocolates waiting for her What actually happened was they asked her to wait while they prepared the room then forgot about her for a couple of hours while she watched other people checking in Then no cava or chocolates in the room When I got there and asked about this the staff said they forgot and would do it the next day and acted like I was being difficult And tbh it was the cheapest cava we could find in the supermarket I believe the bed was standard as well It s little things like this that can make a big difference to ones stay One more thing I asked them if they could arrange a booking at a restaurant for us and the concierge flat out refused and told me they don t do that ,0
 Room wasn t ready on arrival and after being told it would be a few minutes it took an hour and a half before we gave up and went exploring Very poor customer service ,0
 The veiw of my room was very poor,0
 All facilities very old and some of them not working,0
 Spa is not good enough for a 5 star hotel neither is the gym Breakfast should be included but only provided full English breakfast included,0
 Lighting in the sleeping room was very dim brighter bulbs would help We asked and was told that it is s boutique hotel and that s how they want it ,0
 Small choice of food in the pool bar,0
 The carpet after my bed was not so clean,0
 Air condition did not work room was really hot Kept always window open Luckily we were in yard side room no big noise from the street came in ,0
 The front desk lady was quite stiff Usually the more friendly receptionists are those coming Eastern Europe or Spain She did not give the cookies upon check in Rooms are cramped ,0
 Pool wasn t heated would have been nice if heated ,0
 Everything was good,0
 Access by car,0
 The bed were too hard for me but the hotel manager quickly fixed the mattress stiffness problem by adding a thin mattress on top It worked ,0
 The beds were not the most comfortable,0
 Location is excellent being in Dam Square but the downside of this is that outside noise can be heard in the lower rooms at night so perhaps it is best to request a higher floor ,0
 Location very industrial didn t want to walk on my own at night ,0
 Room was a little too dark,0
 The bed was lumpy The room was small and poorly designed There were no drawers to put clothes Water came up in the tub when the neighbors emptied their tub The worst part was the fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night No explanations or apologies were offered the next day I found this very unprofessional False alarms can happen but at least apologize and offer some kind of explanation ,0
 Check in is automated which is great for singles but it is very slow with a group of 10 12 when they are tired and just want to get to their rooms ,0
 When I m arrived to the hotel there is a milk lost inside minibar from a gust and no water for drink in the room ,0
 Shower was uncortabke same as beds Small rooms small TV It did not feel a lot like a 4 start hotel more like a 2 or 1,0
 My room was located to the inner yard I assume the street view is much nicer but as I arrived late I didn t mind ,0
 We had carvery dinner on our first night great selection but again hot food not hot ,0
 Lack of parking,0
 terrible bed in family room not suitable for 2 adults too loud windows looking at the street should be closed all the time otherwise too much noise coming from outside traffic restaurant in front too much overpriced for the current state of the rooms refurbishment needed ,0
 I only went to the Pool room once but there were towels all over the floors and chairs Maybe add a sign that tells guests where to put their towels when they are done swimming Or maybe a staff member can check the swim room every two hours ,0
 Tube wasn t running on this particular weekend which made for packed buses but luckily we like walking ,0
 Location a bit far from the closest tube station,0
 All of it television didn t turn over air con stuck on cold breakfast disgraceful and bedroom sheets had blood on them,0
 Breakfast did not meet the price Little variaty in food Room windows were out towards a shaft were the ventilation was very noisy all night Saturday night we had the pleasure of listening to the loud music from a nearby or in the house disco ,0
 I have stayed here a number of times Standards have dropped took 45 minutes to even get my drink in the restaurant and the bar staff just ignore you well until closing time when they sprang to life The hole place just feels as if the penny pinching has gone too far,0
 Good twenty minutes walk to the station Cab ten Euros each time Adds up,0
 The weather was very warm,0
 Long walk to the tube station ,0
 Rooms bathroom are a little to small the basin in the bathroom was to small to even was my hands in it without water splashing everywhere Breakfast was very basic they could of had a bit more to choose from ,0
 Room was not luxury as stated and bathroom not private enough,0
 1 The staff decided to put hold on credit card for a large amount included our stay breakfast for two days though our initial reservation didn t have breakfast included which seemed very inconvenient and we ended up having a hassle during checkout to calculate accurate amount credit card hold,0
 The TVs in the bar area ,0
 Room anemities housekeeping,0
 Thought reception staff could have been more welcoming they did the job ok but didn t put any soul into it ,0
 Die Adresse ist wrong very difficult to access with auto,0
 The breakfast wasn t fresh and the bread was quite stale The dinner was also overpriced and lacked flavour Shuttle bus service wasn t always on time so was better to just rely on the public bus The wifi constantly disconnected and reconnected ,0
 Breakfast quality needs to be improved,0
 The breakfast is not good and very expensive ,0
 One of the facilities listed was Airport shuttle which we understood to be mean the existence of a hotel shuttle bus service that included the Hotel Royal as one of its stops and this was one of the reasons for choosing the hotel It turned out there was no bus shuttle and the facility only meant a taxi could be ordered through the hotel In the end we used public transport and had no problem in getting to the hotel but I feel the information given in the description was misleading The restaurant was on the pricey side ,0
 It was very far away from the metro station and no transport was offered Having to pay a 25 deposit for each night we stayed was not discussed before we had booked nor after in fact and was only told to us when we arrived to check in This made us feel like the hotel did not trust us and it felt like a scam Our rooms were not cleaned the entire stay ,0
 Room was freezing and they kept turning up the A C From a central location We literally slept with our jackets on Next evening a nice young man by the name of Tom came to our room and went straight for the radiatior which was hidden and turned it on Had we known to do that we would have been a lot happier the first night ,0
 Hair in my bed sheets and broken toilet flusher When i complained in the morning was too late when i got in at 2am they didnt take me seriously,0
 Floors in corridors make noise and made of wood ,0
 The bathroom layout was slightly tricky as the door opened directly onto the large shower cubicle This meant you had to really squeeze around it to get to the toilet ,0
 Lack of free parking,0
 The old building is not up to the quality of the main building,0
 The decor in our room was abit tatty wallpaper starting to peel off the wall ,0
 small room bathroom small lift breakfast not included for us steps to get to lobby level from street,0
 Didn t realise it was alcohol free Room quite expensive,0
 the quality of the food was not good ,0
 Room was very compact,0
 It is too far from the Metro station Collblanc The Breakfast is just normal FC Barcelona Stadium is 20 minutes away Internet Speed is not Fare actually the WiFi is shared with the hotel neighbors because there is no password or security on the network They cant speak English very well ,0
 A baby in the room next door cried for hours I eventually got up at 1 30 a m And rang reception Not sure what they did but it was quieter after the phone call ,0
 Parking You pay 39 euros per day but you cannot enter and exit at leisure You pay for every entrance and exit Would be great if the hotel can have its own parking facilities,0
 At 6 pm when I arrived and went up to the room it was still not cleaned and someone came to clean it when I was there ,0
 All good,0
 Tea Coffee making facilities in the room please,0
 Narrow corridors bed was 2 twins pushed together so very uncomfortable in the middle reception area was just member of staff at a table with a laptop which was a bit strange about 10 mins walk from nearest tube station ,0
 Bad wi fi connection small and uncomfortable bed could not breath from the chlorium smell in the pool no vegan options in breakfast,0
 The tv Internet are extras you have to pay for which seems crazy ,0
 MOULD ON BATHROOM WALLS BATH ENAMEL DAMAGED GROUT MISSING ON BATHROOM FLOOR OULD SEE BARE CONCRETES SERVICE IN BAR POOR PORTION OF FISH POOR ON SUNDAY BETTER ON TUESDAY,0
 Unfortunately the hotel shows on Booking com as Occidental Athenea Mar on Paseo Garcia Faria HOWEVER the sat nav listed it as the Barcelona Athenea Mar on Passeig Garcia Faria so couldn t find it Very stressful when arriving in Barcelona for the first time by car after a very long drive ,0
 Everything was great just felt like something was missing can t say what ,0
 Far away from metro station However the taxi in Milan is cheap ,0
 Expensive so surprised there was no free wifi ,0
 Noisey Very small room ,0
 Air conditioning was too loud so couldn t have it on at night so it got a bit hot Breakfast is too expensive but there are lots of local places to choose from ,0
 Personally I don t like places with automated check in Machines were OK and staff were on hand to assist but my preference is just to go to desk and have someone check me in ,0
 Free bottled water would have been nice from a 5 star hotel and also tea making facilities that you didnt have to pay for ,0
 Tiny fridge could not put personal items in Don t touch anything if you move a can the sensor will charge it to your room Double check your bill Staff will fix the bill at the end however I really really would of liked to put some of my own drinks in fridge ,0
 Hanging space for clothing,0
 the double room was really a broom cupboard VERY small ,0
 First visit room was a little small I had to prepare for work and there was no much space to put my books and laptop second visit they let me choose my room wonderful Slight noise in the bathroom,0
 Leaky bathroom ,0
 The rooms facing the main road can be noisy as the tram passes in front of the hotel Also its quite far from the centre but both tram takes you there easily ,0
 Spa appointments were unreliable The therapist was late and that was going to cut into MY treatment time So I cancelled my therapy Also the shower box had a strange musty smell that was dealt with but it didn t completely disappear,0
 Not very central to shopping or touristic areas,0
 Minor thing dust and a better clean up in the bedrooms ,0
 I was disappointed that we could not open the bedroom window as the A C was not very comfortable and was pretty noisy Property needs upgrading and modernising It was not very attractive to look at when we arrived but the experience was much better ,0
 Location was very cut off in feeling from the rest of the city great only if you were on business travel for nearby meetings Staff were not incredibly welcoming,0
 The staff at the desk when tried to call for any thing they were unhelpful and actually the were rude ,0
 Fitness area in partner hotel could be more up to date and larger,0
 Very poor internet staff not interested in the guests noisy next to highway lifts broken and slow,0
 The air con didn t work it was a bit run down and not cleaned properly The beds were also not very comfortable I would rate this hotel as Max 3 stars ,0
 Air conditioning needs better control too hot,0
 the breakfast was not very good and not value for money,0
 my room was really small but ok The floor I was on 1st looked shabby and in need of TLC but that was about it on the down side,0
 The chilli con carne is revolting,0
 Coffee quality not so great ,0
 Rooms are small and unclean bed sheet were dirty and covered in hair Room full of dust and needs a deep clean Arrived in the evening to check in to be told that we had to pay 50 deposit when I questioned this the receptionist was very rude to us Felt more like a inconvenience then a guest Don t bother paying for breakfast it s bread no toaster cereal and fruit not worth the money Hotel is way over priced and I m very surprised it s a best western very poor hotel in general,0
 Rather far from city center transport About 25 min by feet No bathrobes No slippers No hygenic sets No teapot no tea coffee Sound of trains all the time Old furniture Broken shower The room was not prepared when we arrived had to wait about 3 4 hours No free wifi in fact ,0
 The breakfast was not brilliant kept having to ask for more tea and thought was overpriced for the quality ,0
 Cups in the rooms I d like mugs plus would like hot chocolate sachets as well as tea and coffee,0
 The room is somewhat small even though the front desk staff told us that we got and upgrade ,0
 Over priced,0
 The halls and elevator areas of first impression in need of replacement Stained and worn Food options expensive breakfast or none ,0
 Faint smell of water unavoidable in Venice I guess Deoderizas in room did help ,0
 Totally impractical room The bathroom had no space at all for toiletries There was nowhere in front of a mirror apart from sitting on the floor to dry your hair The bed was too big for space so you constantly bumped into it And this was one we paid to upgrade to ,0
 Rooms didn t look as smart as online photo s of rooms,0
 Rooms are very small but this is to be expected in Paris and was not an issue,0
 Room service was late,0
 Not comfortable bed noisy surrounding,0
 Everything but the location ,0
 The fried eggs are stored in a hot plate n by the time you get to them the sunny side up is all dehydrated hardened poached Also no luggage service is available,0
 all expect location,0
 The room was dark even with all lights turned on ,0
 Bathroom needs a cabinet or shelf for cosmetics ,0
 there was a total power cut from 5am until i left at 8am There was no notification from staff like a note pushed under the doors so it was up to us to walk down to reception and ask the single member of staff what was going on i therefore had to shower and try to get ready using just a phone light When i asked for a refund i was told that the GM had said no refunds and so it was down to the reception staff to pass this message on The GM should have been there ,0
 Too many corporate groups using hotel facilities ,0
 The whole sorry experience,0
 Ground floor room a bit noisy early in the morning,0
 It wasn t easy to maneuver the streets even using a map Somewhat tucked away from things ,0
 Swimming pool was empty and internet sucks,0
 Size of the room for a 4 is way too small We requested a twin beds room and there was no space left in the room Bathroom is tight but has quality features ,0
 Room a little cramped ,0
 Rooms too small and noisy at the second floor closed to Club Room ,0
 Our room was near a fire door which banged loudly early morning waking us up easy to fix I would think One small lift which proved a small problem at breakfast when lots of people moving from floor to floor,0
 Quite noisy ,0
 The bed was not at all comfortable I could feel almost every spring under me as I moved It was certainly not what I have experienced in other Hilton hotels ,0
 No breakfast and better signage to find the hotel,0
 Lack of car parking for guests ,0
 Leaving,0
 cracked sink and cracked tilein the bathroom old dirty windowns,0
 The ceiling was leaking,0
 Bigger tv required Modernised rooms,0
 We turned thermostat as low as possible but room still very hot ,0

 Breakfast would have have put the icing on the cake but a small price to pay to stay at this fantastic place ,0
 My e mail was used without my consent to contact me with promotional material I complaint about this but never received an explanation ,0
 Smoke alarm starts at 2 30 in the morning by cigar in one room They must find a way to check before the alarm start working,0
 Single room at back of hotel facing a brick wall,0
 Old hotel noisy unstable wifi room isolation is poor magnatic key failed to open my door repeatedly and had to rest it 3 times in reception Shawer is extremely small ,0
 Room was a little basic but fair for the price ,0
 Receptionist attitude,0
 Its a major ripp off They have been charging for everything Even though we stayed in Junior suite we still had to pay extra for breakfast spa parking etc,0
 Only plugs one side of the bed and bathroom is a wet room with shower with a fan that didn t really work but these were minor details ,0
 Some of the staff were a bit abrupt,0
 There is no kettle in rooms so feel a bit inconvenient ,0
 Going home,0
 N A,0
 Thought the breakfast price was a bit high so if it was lower then we probably would have tried it,0
 Air conditioning didn t work ,0
 Staff not very eager to provide good service Specially one of the guys at reception who was always very grumpy and was very inefficient ,0
 The hotel lobby and bar restaurant area were extremely hot It would be more comfortable in a cooler atmosphere We have used this hotel twice now and both times need to queue a fair time to book in at reception ,0
 Breakfast room is really below 4 star hotel standard ,0
 Firmer beds maybe ,0
 Thought it would be easier to find A bit misleading when it s called The Square Duomo Also although the room was very good there were no drawers ,0
 Air conditioner Doesn t give effective cooling,0
 I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer,0
 A plus side would be to have air conditioning in the rooms It was exceptionally hot on the day I visited and ventilation in the room was poor ,0
 Noises at 6am,0
 Air conditioning for shower didn t work room was warm lack of view,0
 Cleanliness services were perfect,0
 Couldn t see any information about how to connect to wifi in room No bottles of water in room Minor issues though ,0
 The bathroom was very dated and we didn t have much hot water but we were only there for one night and the room itself was cosy and the beds comfy so it didn t matter at all ,0
 No stairs iMac tv was poor,0
 breakfast too expensive to be an option meant leaving with an empty stomach ,0
 Towels were changed even though we didn t leave them out to be done Breakfast was a little expensive but there was tremendous choice ,0
 Have tried to think of things and to be honest can t Everything was just as we expected and nicely so ,0
 The room was little bit dirty and then the the reciptoon guy changed the rooms for a netter ones and the apartmenta was located in the 5th with no elevator and plus the intercom was broken soo yuou need to go upstairs and down just if u got a visit,0
 Breakfast buffet is not what I am used to in hotels that level and price ,0
 Breakfast buffet was ok compared to other hotels of this calibre ,0
 Was a special visit gave us an apple orange banana Dirty beds sheets not changed for 3 days left on the fourth day maybe that s when they change them Toilet fan not working Water coming out the wall back of the shower plumber needed why were these things not picked up before we were given the room key I bet the bus loads of German tourists weren t put in those rooms 19 80 for two Brandies The manager we complained too offered us an upgrade on our next visit won t be back ,0
 Very basic room firm bed Very outdated rooms Broken hairdryer ,0
 bed too soft breakfast was ok but was expecting better from a 4 stars,0
 Rooms were not very nice at all Building works and loud noises ,0
 Most 5 star hotels have a nespresso machine in the room these days This was a notable omission ,0
 All OK no faults,0
 The price can vary so much on this occasion the nightly rate was exceptionally excessive,0
 I would have liked a room at the front,0
 Just wish I could ve stayed longer ,0
 My room number 353 was very much in need of refurbishment the brown carpet was both ugly and dirty looking and completely off putting also the mattress was lumpy and grossly uncomfortable obviously should have been discarded years ago As a matter of fact a most unfortunate experience and personally one could say equivelant to a 2 star hotel ,0
 Speed of service in floor 18 bar,0
 The two bed were not stable and drifted apart The cord of the hair dryer was too short ,0
 room was dirty and very dusty ,0
 Breakfast was way too expensive for anyone staying a few days ,0
 breakfast much too expensive 17 euro,0
 Short staffed at breakfast and things were running out quickly with staff running around trying to keep up ,0
 Extra charge for champagne fir breakfast on first day but not on 2nd day,0
 We were very displeased that wifi in rooms was not complimentary As a result we did not pay and needed to be in the lounge to make plans and check emails This is the only hotel of many that we have stayed in recently that had such inconvenient wifi We thought the hotel would give better complimentary service ,0
 The price which for one of the nights was very high even for London,0
 I could here running water all night and it took me ages to find where it was coming from I did not complain as I did not want the bother of changing rooms However after 3 restless nights I wish I had ,0
 I have just 2 minor complaints One was that the elevators were extremely small They were just big enough for 2 or 3 people which means you had to wait for the next one to come if someone had their luggage with them since you would not fit in Also there was no taparello metal outdoor shutter for the bedroom window It is not necessary when you are on an upper floor but our room overlooked a flat roof which made our room accessible through the window I would have preferred to lower the taparello when we were out of the room for security reasons ,0
 I could ve had a longer stay ,0
 Couldn t get on Wifi ,0
 Price of food and drink was very unreasonable for example 8 euros for half lager or 28 euros for breakfast not good value for money Also the selection of food available is poor,0
 Initially we were not given the room we had booked we got it the next day so we had to repack and unpack twice,0
 the cleaning people were a bit too pushy check out was at 12 and since 9 am someone came 4 5 times to ask if we are still there ,0
 No free WiFi in guest rooms was a bit surprising ,0
 Parking allocation could have been managed better ,0
 City airport very close by but not too busy or noisy,0
 The bed wasn t especially comfortable and the high tech lighting was too complicated for me to understand Same with the heating and cooling We never did figure out the television For the cost of one night I was hoping for a bit more actual luxury and not just the appearances of it The staff made you feel like a star but the actual accomodations were a bit wanting for star quality ,0
 The hotel generally is a bit shabby and being tucked down a corridor in a very scruffy room past where the cleaners congregate with their equipment in the morning I m glad I was only there one night,0
 Wi fi was was weak and not stable ,0
 Bathroom fairly old and shabby,0
 The noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed,0
 The bed was a small double and therefore too small for two adults We couldn t co ordinate the light switches to only have the lights above the bed on in the evening ,0
 Room was a bit small but not unusual in Central London to find that but in fairness it was very clean and functional ,0
 May be more breakfast menu for those not eating pork,0
 My room was noisy probably next to the office or something The light bulbs in the room went on and off during the 3 nights ,0
 The rooms looked very dated bland and uninspiring ,0
 I upgraded to an executive suite which was a bit small This allowed free use of the mini bar which had a very small selection This was never fully restocked even though I requested it be replenished daily Turn down service only occurred twice in 5 nights Hotel was fine otherwise but the service was poor ,0
 breakfast wasn t available on site but plenty of places around,0
 Bathroom not clean,0
 Internet was slow Elevator was small and slow,0
 Room a bit small,0
 The ground floor entrance was smelly and of poor decor with stains on walls,0
 No tea coffee making facilities in the room No bottled water ,0
 View from the room ,0
 strange and dishonest staff klaustrofobic room and walls so thin that the snoring from neighboring room might keep you up all night I wouldn t say a nightmare but not far off ,0
 Narrow corridors with steps in some places acceptable room size in club rooms ,0
 Difficult to find any thing ,0
 Price of extras was ridiculous,0
 The wellness centre area is in a poor state of repair with bits of card board taped to the walls to cover up some problems The area around the pool needs repainted as there is a lot of rusty bits The changing rooms did not have nice toiletry dispensers or products which I would normally expect from this sort of hotel they were clean though ,0
 I suppose the bar experience was quite good with very good and friendly staff The price of drinks was i felt high hence the reason why very few were there when frequented it ,0
 On our floor 46th there was a funky smell like rotten water ,0
 Could do with a jacuzzi in the spa to really make it perfect ,0
 This hotel was perfect ,0
 Something has gone wrong the rooms were not as clean as normal and maintenance seems to have stopped Not good broken toilet and dirty shower and both really easy to fix Come on management you are spoiling a good hotel ,0
 No ironing board in thw room,0
 The rooms could use a little more lighting they are a little on the dim and romantic side I was traveling with my mother ,0
 Room could have better view backside from hotel although requested from front side ,0
 It would have been nice to have a more welcoming reception area somewhere to sit in the evening with a drink perhaps without having to sit in the restaurant area Not all of the equipment in the fitness suite was working worth someone checking this on a daily basis Finally as a tea drinking Brit bigger tea cups ie mugs are essential ,0
 The room size was small,0
 I thought the TV channel availability could be better particularly sports ,0
 Stayed there for a few times different floors and rooms but for some reason this last time I was given a room for a disabled person No big deal but it could have been better in terms of cleanliness and I prefer the other rooms ,0
 As every hotel the prices of the mini bar are so expensive,0
 Was not told of 50 per day service charge for minibar room service etc not an inconvenience just felt as though we should have been made aware of this,0
 In room menu,0
 There wasn t anything to complain about ,0
 Prices in the mini bar too expensive especially for water,0
 no parking costs 28 euro per night no facilities room is tight for family,0
 Everything of the hotel,0
 Expensive Size of original room ,0
 Room rate is a little on higher side compared to other 4 star hotels in the area ,0
 Strong cleaning smells in foyer and corridors,0
 Its location,0
 Bathroom was not clean and looks very old room lighting is not enough no butler to carry the luggage ,0
 Our room was very stylish but lacking in enough storage space for clothes ,0
 We had a suite but it was a little small and no views ,0
 Staff had to fix TV remote as it did not work properly Had trouble working out how to use the shower needs instructions Never enough milk left with coffee tea Doona cover not fastened at bottom making it uncomfortable Towels changed even though I hung them up New soaps put out when not necessary ,0
 staff and size of room very small,0
 Room is small,0
 Everything heating was not working hotel staff was rude and not helpful arrogant no service had to go to another building to find my room beakfast was bad generally a very bad hotel and wandering why 5 Star should be max 3 star,0
 I booked in via booking com The mix up began when I arrived at the hotel The room was too small and then I was told I can have an upgrade this did not happen The lack of clarity and mix ups No GM in a 115 room hotel Front Office manager takes care things poorly No fridge TV is minuscule inside drawers are dirty,0
 This is our 3rd stay at this hotel but it was for the first time that I ve noticed how thin the wall to the neighbour room is we could easily hear our daughter chatting and laughing with her friend Probably it depends of the room because as I said before I haven t noticed this ,0
 Parking fees uncomfortable beds noise from refurbishment ,0
 The weather,0
 The bed was in fact two beds and the mattresses a bit hard ,0
 No window view Internal light well only Facilities in room for tea and coffee but no kettle guests expected to take cup to dining room for hot water through heavy fire doors and narrow concrete stairs in comunial area to floor below ,0
 bed a bit soft desk in room a bit small,0
 The room was on the small side though well appointed and quiet ,0
 An improvement would be to have power points and mirrors together to be able to style hair The mirror available for applying makeup was not good and apart from the full length mirror behind the door which had no lighting there was no other mirror ,0
 Pretty much everything in an awful area not safe to walk home from metro at night Beds are so uncomfortable Air conditioning was worthless also,0
 The bathtub had a little problem and as we were on a Sunday there there was no one to fix it The room had a view on the outdoor stairs ,0
 Noting,0
 Room outlook obscured by ventilation ducts,0
 I had to move rooms due to the window either being broken or would not close as it was wide open 3rd room lucky,0
 We were in a lovely room the bathroom and the bed were excellent however we were overlooking the side street to the east The noise was terrible the window had to be fixed after day one but overall the sound proofing could have been much better It was a shame as it took away from an otherwise a great hotel ,0
 If you opened the window there are uncontinue loudly sound whole night ,0
 The price but its right in the middle of London and couldn t have been much better ,0
 The room size,0
 No opening windows or balconies needs adding to their room description ,0
 expensive breakfast for a small selection Terrible hard pillows gave up and slept on a jumper I had Ridiculously slow checking in time you will find this is the most irritating thing I waited 20minutes perhaps longer,0
 the room was rather small the air conditioner was noisy we could hear water draining from other bathrooms ,0
 The Drains smelt badly in the Bathroom and the Air conditioning is loud the Breakfast room is in the Basement with no windows it felt hot and claustrophobic to us ,0
 We booked a Junior Supirior Suite The 2nd double bed was a sleeping couch This was very small for 2 adults and not so flat ,0
 Some of the hotel areas were not so clean and it smelled Bed was not comfortable at all so dose the pillow,0
 Rooms had windows but they were facing the wall no natural sun light ,0
 My only slight dissatisfaction was the breakfast It was not expensive but it wasn t great either Perhaps it had been there for a while since we did not eat early but some of it didn t taste fresh at all ,0
 Traffic noise from street disturbed my sleep ,0
 The hotel is old and not quite up to today s standards but ok as a budget alternative for a few days Possibly it s a four star Inn and pub but I would rate it as a two star comparing to regular hotel standards so it did not quite live up to my expectations ,0
 The room was a bit small but then it is a student hotel ,0
 Restaurant staff was not very nice We were an inconvenience to them A bit pricey but still a nice stay ,0
 I appreciated the old building but that was all I like about it ,0
 Bathrooms was very old Showerhead didnt work good and it spreaded water everywhere ,0
 We couldn t check into the room until after 16 00 there was no parking space available despite having requested it at time of booking ,0
 Na,0
 Housekeeping of our room was very poor we had to complain Air con was noisy we thought,0
 Room was dark View from window was wall of next building ,0
 Breakfast was average,0
 Very poor service across the board from all the staff Very small rooms with poor lighting Uncomfortable beds ,0
 Everything was excellent ,0
 The rooms are generally well used and need updating,0
 Rooms on top floor very warm,0
 The fact that 50 pounds per night were blocked from the account for instance,0
 LET S IMPROVE ON THE BREAKFAST QUALITY OF THE BACON AND SCRAMBLED EGGS VERY AVERAGE JUICE TEA GOOD,0
 Noisy from road if you wanted the windows open,0
 The hotel was over booked and the place was chaotic breakfast was a complete shambles and totally disorganised The rooms were small and in need of a makeover Definitely not 4 ,0
 The hotel design ,0
 Pool facilities on the small side Gym and excercise area disproportionately large for the small changing area,0
 Unfortunetly the boiler broke down in the night and our room was very cold and still hadn t been fixed in the morning at 9 30 am so woke up cold in the night and couldn t have a shower before leaving the hotel so left to warm up in a near by cafe ,0
 Very Poor internet connection ,0
 but the rest of the hotel was in urgent need of a refurb The rooms were small and old ,0
 Being charged more than I had with booking com although I believe a weakness and lack of transparency of booking com ,0
 Food s quality and taste does not match the price Laundry is expensive too ,0
 No separation between shower and toilet so the entire bathroom got soaked whilst Having a shower ,0
 The window in the room was broken and fixed with duct tape whaat Heating A C in the room was living its own life The hotel is too far from public transport and center During check out they mistakenly charged money for second time ,0
 The room was very hot at night ,0
 Expensive restaurant on site,0
 There is a lack of lighting in a room to dark in my point of view To drive in out of the garage would test your driver skill to limit especially if you drive a big car ,0
 My only complaint was the breakfast However it was only a minor complaint and the cost was deducted from my bill without question ,0
 Staff were quite difficult to understand Very expensive drinks Bathplug didn t work,0
 We weren t mad on the bar felt that it could be updated however we still enjoyed a few drinks there ,0
 Our room was very small and in the lower ground ,0
 Location was central but getting to the hotel from public transport was not easy to navigate,0
 Although we frequently stayed at the Wyndham Apollo in the past they put us in a dark dungeon style room 020 way below sea canal level The receptionist stated dit is een leuke kamer A joke ,0
 The only negative is that the hotel needs a facelift It could be returned to its former glory by just a lick of paint ,0
 Looking a little tired and in need of decoration ,0
 The bed is too hard ATM not on site,0
 Bedroom was really warm Bed was too hard ,0
 Rip off in terms of nightly rate ,0
 Room was a bit cold Heater seemed to be broken ,0
 The tub was dangerous,0
 Safe in room on cupboard floor and only hand held shower,0
 We had cups and tea and coffee but no kettle So therefore we could not make a cup of tea We ask reception and they said they did not have any kettles Should not put cups and tea bags in the room then ,0
 The fact that there were no pay movies would have liked to watch a movie the few English chanels were not that great ,0
 Breakfast was expensive,0
 The surroundings looked a bit dirty but the hotel was just perfect,0
 Breakfast in the basement and horrible choice ,0
 Thin walls an alarm clock ringing in another room kept us awake ,0
 No complaints at all ,0
 Sound insulation,0
 Queue to check in was very long and had been on the two occasions I have stayed ,0
 Breakfast room small for the amount of people Felt very busy and had to wait a while for drinks The food was good standard though ,0
 The restaurant was abismal Staff were rude and ignorant Didn t feel like we were treated as paying guests we were spoken to like riff raff just off the street A sign was up to say restaurant open at 11 30 we waited half an hour until 25 to 12 just to be very rudely told that it actually wasn t open until 12 The waiter was visibly looking down at us I felt like I wasn t really welcome there We reluctantly returned the next day after 12 to grab a quick lunch which turned into a 50minute wait for a salad and a burger Guests who came in 15 20mins after us were being served and there was food lying on the kitchen counter very much resembling a salad for over 25mins which was ready to be served when I questioned the wait on the food I received a rude response saying a group which had made a reservation at 8am that morning were in so that s why there is a long wait First of all we were not made aware of this before ordering Secondly if the group had made a reservation surely the staff should have been much more prepared for this Thirdly just because there is a group of people who made a reservation that should not mean that 2 people wont get their food for almost 1hour I was absolutely appalled by the service or lack there of It has completely put me off returning to this hotel and will be sure not to recommend to anyone ,0
 price quality ratio is not satisfactory,0
 No fridge,0
 Rooms were a touch small ,0
 Had to ask were to go to check in as i could nt see the sign for reception but the polite member of the bar staff pointed us in the right direction the room was but felt it was on the small side ,0
 windows cannot be opened some fresh air would feel good in the late evening furniture was a little run down shelves patched with duct tape ,0
 Condition of the room ,0
 No USP connections and the room is not sound proof from the nearest rooms,0
 The wi fi didnt work properly and would either cut out or have very poor signal the fitness room was also very basic with 2 running machines and a few other very basic machines which would be more suited to home use as opposed to commercial There was also no free weights ,0
 Service at check in was poor,0
 No tea making facilities no water no tissues no iron,0
 CHECK IN TOOK AGES THEY NEVER TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT BREAKFAST TIMES WE ENDED UP MISSING IT ON THE 2ND DAY THE MONDAY AS THE SUNDAY TIME WAS DIFFERENT RUBBISH CONSIDERING WE PAID 15 EACH FOR IT,0
 Breakfast should really be included for 350 per night tariff And there should not be a great kafuffle at the restaurant when you request a non pre ordered breakfast The breakfast hot plate was very far from hot ,0
 As we were traveling with our baby we should have had a larger room We could barely move with the cradle in the room and had to move it everytime we needed to go to the bathroom We ordered a baby soup but it was not ready on time and only had 2 of the 5 ingredients I asked It seemed a good hotel good for who s travelling for business purposes rather than family vacations ,0
 Only 1 pillow each on the bed Also the kettle completely siphoned out with boiling water when I first put it on Unfortunately a member of staff with extremely limited English was sent to deal with it and he had no idea what we were trying to explain had happened This also fused all the sockets in our room and our friends room next door ,0
 We booked a twin room but it was a room with a double bed and a very little foldable one My daughter and me used the same bed to sleep And the room didn t have good light at bathroom to make up only works one bulb And in a room for two people only have a chair to take breakfast ,0
 Poor evening night staff Taking us up to our room as our card didn t work three times and Did not apologise walked off for 2 minutes with no explanation and got out his phone and used WhatsApp while handling our issue ,0
 Check in was a bit of a drag as hotel had a problem on the night I checked in but was offered a night at their sister hotel across the road Went back to the main hotel for my 2nd night and was offered a free upgrade ,0
 THE SERVICE MY ROOM STILL HAD NOT BEEN MADE UP BY 2PM ALTHOUGH I HAD BEEN OUT OF IT SINCE 8AM WITH A SIGN TO SAY PLEASE MAKE UP WHEN IT WAS IT WAS HURRIED THERE WAS NO NEW BATHROOM TUMBLER I HAD TO FIT THE BULB FOR MY BEDSIDE LIGHT,0
 The modern decor in reception actually made it look slightly scruffy ,0
 Stayed on a Saturday night and the live music was a little distracting We knew about this in advance and it finished at 11pm so wasn t too disturbing ,0
 I found the hotel a little too warm for my tastes,0
 Decor tired staff on the whole not particularly friendly no English channels on tv hence not particularly child friendly wifi not working properly ,0
 The staff didn t recommend a more cost effective way to airport He suggested to take a shuttle which would be slower then RER B and costs more They were helpful to cancel my reservation of the shuttle after I found it from other source ,0
 Would have been better to have an iron available in the room and or an ironing room on the same floor,0
 Alarm goes off in the night if the door isn t firmly closed Insistance on being escorted to room when we could easily find it on our own ,0
 Shabby smelly room,0
 We were astonished that the laundry service offered leave in bag in the room before 10am and it will be returned same day before 6pm turned into being collected same afternoon only as we returned from city centre visiting and after laundry staff were prompted by reception desk The clothes would be back manyana said the maid but it took a reception agent to chase and deliver it himself that next day at 8pm ,0
 Rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism I relocated Wifi throughput erratic TV cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took 2 days to fix this Spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on For 240 per night I would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge Little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments ,0
 Service in restaurant very slow,0
 People in next room were very noisy From extremely early morning both mornings and late at night Could hear their third party telephone conversations,0
 Better pillows,0
 Paid for a double room and wasn t to happy to find the bed was two singles pushed together Even though the WiFi was free it kept cutting out and the tv didn t work properly As we were only staying 1 night it wasn t to much of a problem but had we been staying longer it may have been ,0
 Little things here and there could be improved Shower was a bit old and needed an update Coffee in the room but only decaf Elevator was extremely small And even though we put the towels on the floor they still hung them back up on the racks so they were wet the next day Also even though we requested an iron they never brought one ,0
 Room was VERY small Strong smell of curry and spices from restaurant below Cramped throughout,0
 We returned back at 15 15 and our room had not been cleaned they came at around 15 45 however that was not convenient they suggest they come when we were out in the evening which they did however only did half a job We have stayed at lots of 4 and 5 star hotel here and in the USA this is a good 4 star The staff were of 5 star standard other than the cleaning organiser,0
 Hotel Vienna is overall supposed to be Viennese semi luxury but actually it is totally outdated with some 90 s updates which makes it even worst in terms of deco style and appearance The corridors are with heavy old carpets and smell although there is no smoking looks like no one follows the rules even the staff Only 1 small lift for cutest and staff which is slow and smells all the time The rooms are not as spacious as it looks on the photos advertised they have used the usual advertisements tricks The coffe and Tea advertised as complimentary are just one off after that if you whant to have every day you need to pay for it There is a coffeemaker and a kettle too The mini bar is totally overpriced The cleaning services are daily but if you whant your bedding and towering change you need to ask for it The heating is very hot you need to adgest it yourself or ask receptionist they are no guides for it There are no wardrobes but more like a small box with few hangers 1 chair and 1 small stool in luxury double room which we had The bathroom has no air conditioner and the baths are outdated with shower facing the wrong way The hairdryer is from the 80 s and makes such a nose that is scary to use The rooms are with thin wals and you can prakticly hear everything in your naibour rooms if you are lucky and get a room next to the flying stewards you will get lots of different noises all night long TV is smal and programs only local not even an international news channels Internet if working most of the time but kind of slow practically not for business use We spend 10 days over Christmas and New Year and expected a bit more from the food menu since it was a festive season unfortunately the breakfast was the same and overpriced and lunch diner was not worth it ,0
 The room and bar dining room areas are not to the standard of a 4 star hotel The breakfast buffet was under staffed and the variety on offer was poor for a hotel of this star rating The bedroom furniture and fittings need attention ,0
 I left my sweater in the room and could not get it back ,0
 Every thing else,0
 internet was not stable and not very fast,0
 Our room was on the small side and didn t have any natural light The window looked straight onto a wall,0
 I was kept waiting at reception while 3 members of staff were chatting to one guest then casually made his way over to me after ,0
 Room service food was average although the buffet breakfast was good ,0
 Ermm I wasn t really sure why my guests had to sign in and out of the property Made me feel like a child and my parents sere checking up on me ,0
 Prices,0
 Gym facilities were very poor,0
 Definitely not 4 stars No business center full time restaurant and the luge small bar in the open lobby was poor Toilets do not cleanse the bowl properly and the stairwells were filthy I would not stay there again ,0
 Internet was very slow in bedroom ,0
 Not much to say a bit disappointed they were no party for the guests from the hotel when we arrived everything was already sold out No other alternatives The lift can be annoying sometimes we had to wait over 5 minutes for the lift to come seems only one was working not a complaint but some hotel guests were complaining ,0
 No,0
 toilet wasn t clean I found an organic dirty ,0
 Small room Restroom divided into 2 tiny rooms No facilities ,0
 The hotel is in need of some maintenance our first room did not have a working air conditioner some light bulbs needed replacing and the maid service was inconsistent in the replacement of towels and cups and vacuuming ,0
 Breakfast was pretty good but not worth the additional expense,0
 It cost more to book direct ,0
 most places were closed due to summer holiday ,0
 We were informed it would be a king sized bed Not 2 beds pushed together Not exactly comfortable They couldn t even be bothered to clean the room When we moved in there were another ladies fake nails lying in the bathroom and all over the rooms floor Underneath the bed certainly hadn t seen a Hoover in as many weeks it was disgusting Inside the wardrobe Al though the disgusting habit of another Probably previous guest had left chewing gum stuck inside the wardrobe All above was raised in a polite manner with reception They informed us they would have the room cleaned immediately When we returned they had presented a nice fruit platter a bottle of wine and an apology note which was a really nice thing to do But they had actually forgotten to clean the room It would have been nice to use the complimentary coffee and machine they provide for guest who pay the extra for the prestige room But as above not only do they forget to clean your room they forget about the coffee station also So not only unkept but un replenished The breakfast hours are fantastic 07 00 till 11 00 We thought this would be great unfortunately the breakfast area is only big enough to accommodate maybe 10 rooms at 1 time So best try and get there early as you may not be able to sit for breakfast or they may not be anything left After day 2 we decided to eat out for breakfast It was just a disgrace ,0
 The hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working 24 7 you can not imagine the noise check the photos No refrigerator Room was rather small,0
 Meal prices very expensive even breakfast Free wireless internet was useless ran at dial up speeds and dropped out all the time Room was small and we booked the executive room First room we were given had a view of a brick wall,0
 The Wi Fi was weak,0
 Small ensuite,0
 hotel is tired rooms need refurbishment wifi poor expensive,0
 Little bit more room in dining area,0
 Staff not attentive to needs of customers,0
 Bad heating old facility very congested Breakfast options very limited Rooms wee very small,0
 All,0
 The rooms too small and old fashioned,0
 That I didn t book in for another night,0
 N a,0
 Housekeeping was not up to the standard of the hotel otherwise the staff was extremely friendly Our basic room facing the rear of the hotel is good for brief stay ,0
 To renovate the hotel ,0
 only thing was water pressure on 6th floor a bit hit and miss but warm enough ,0
 Cannot think of something I didn t like,0
 The property are perfect also ,0
 Location is too far room without window dirty bathroom no fridge,0
 The room was not well illuminated and small ,0
 A British hotel not having provision for making tea in the room Also it was inconvenient not to have walk in shower ,0
 We weren t that happy about the sink being outside the bathroom and the transparency of the shower ,0
 air conditioning was not great would like an option for BB only rather than being obliged for the Half board ,0
 The room allocated to us was very small ,0
 Very noisy given there was construction next door I would have preferred being informed of it at time of booking ,0
 Room was dark and the window overlooked a roof and another room thus we never saw the outside ,0
 We were put in a disabled room and also the shower flooded thought the room Wetting the bottom of are clothes We the had to change rooms,0
 Toilet gushing water all night,0
 There was no kettle to make tea in the room We had a no window view just looked into another block of rooms Some of the staff didn t speak English well Seemed like there were new staff each day hard to connect with anyone personally ,0
 Late night bar NYE booked by private party Other bar lacked atmosphere and so we didn t stay ,0
 Relatively expensive Fee not include breakfast,0
 Lack of Kettle in the room cant beat that wake up cuppa Bar prices a little steep,0
 Not very visible from the road and the entrance with stairs is not the best welcoming The carpet would need to be replaced on the stairs and in part of the room Sadly wifi was not working on my devices ,0
 The room was chosen as it was meant to be quiet but the pipes were very noisy The room was also set to be at 25 degrees at least and too warm for myself and so by the time I realised this and it was later in the evening the fan was on all night adding to the other noises The hotel was quite pricey I think for the type of room ,0
 Pillows very hard ,0
 The standard rooms are rather small Apart from an office style chair there was nowhere comfortable to sit which was disappointing for a double room The breakfasts are expensive ,0
 Small rooms There is no wall seperating the bathroom and the room,0
 Hotel took two extra payments out of my account which I am still waiting for ,0
 No toiletries when housekeeping had gone home for those forgotten Eggs benedict on a Sunday morning best avoid ,0
 spa area looked much more promising on the picturs compared to reality,0
 Lights kept turning off in room Housekeeping didn t remove room service plates from night before or replenish tissues flannels or hand towels,0
 Room was slightly too small for three people,0
 Lifts were very slow and over crowded we had to wait for 4 lifts before we could get in one There weren t clear signs to the stairs which we would have taken instead Building work happening in the hotel which we were not aware of prior to stay and the hotel bar area was unstaffed when we got back for a nightcap at 10pm,0
 Service at checkout shocking again Breakfast without a smile ,0
 Location a little away from the city,0
 The bathroom could have been a tad bigger ,0
 If you wanted a bath robe you had to request for one,0
 Price was high,0
 Absolutely perfect If one were to complain that it could be closer it would negate the reality that closer hotels are more expensive with often less features and smaller rooms ,0
 I was in room 302 which is close to the cleaners lock room and the cleaner bangs the door all day including early morning so its impossible to sleep passed 7 am ,0
 The shower room has no full door So when I shower water is splattered out They need to fully enclosed shower ,0
 The Wi Fi was spotty on the rooms but great on the reception area ,0
 Located in a strange neighborhood this hotel gives an impression of a once shishy place Loud noise in the backyard prevents travellers from enjoying open balcony ,0
 The staff aren t very welcoming a different vibe from the Experience Department email we received prior to arriving ,0
 not super clean lift only allow one person with luggage ,0
 cleaners felt like they needed to check the room 3 times after it had been cleaned we were still in bed,0
 The building was a lovely early victorian one with our room at basement just below street level I would add that we were offered the room with the three single beds instead of a double and a single and we chose to accept this The room was very good with lots of space and lovely bathroom but because it was at basement level it was cold The room had lovely thick curtains but ai night the cold seemed to permeate through the walls We mentioned it to reception on leaving However it would not stop me from staying there again ,0
 Stains on carpet and furnishings Bathroom was not clean Bath needed fixing Had to call reception for soap Long time to be answered Bad smell in hallways outside room ,0
 Cold room Bad fitted curtains light in the room very early in the morning making impossible a good rest ,0
 when i confirm my booking i did make a request if its possible to have a view of the queens park the gentleman staff says it been arrange already means confirmed when we chick in we ve been located to the most hidden place and we can only see train tracks and walls ,0
 Broken air con in room,0
 price,0
 Couples travelling with large bags need a Club Room just to have a little space ,0
 Curtains sheers and curtain rods falling off the ceiling Walls needed painting very badly Carpets dirty Bathroom tub and shower had black mold between tub and tiles The fact you had to pay for the Internet and wifi and it didn t work most of the time Would not consider this to be a 4 star hotel after staying in other 4 star hotels,0
 Our initial allocation of a room on the 2nd floor this floor has yet to be renovated and was a smoking floor We complained and were immediately relocated to Level 5 which was terrific ,0
 Breakfast was a bit disappointing ,0
 No air con carpwts generate so much static everytime I toyches a light switch wtc I got a shock No iron 25 for 2 shirts and jeans to be ironed and all electrical sockets are old style italian so normal 2 pin for my laptop wouln t fit,0
 Although breakfast was included in the price we still had to pay 10 pounds extra for English breakfast namely for something salty ,0
 Room slippers and shower cap should be included in the package ,0
 Breakfast can be a bit better ,0
 Very small room noisy AC from the roof could be clener ,0
 The room is very old not nice should not be Helton name ,0
 the beaches around hotel,0
 Heating in the bathroom was not working cleanliness must be improved both in the room and in the bathroom The size of the room that we got was not really suited for 4 persons different size room from the one in the pictures ,0
 The only bar area was on the roof terrace would have been nice if the first floor lounge had a bar coffee service as well Also it was very noisey in the bedrooms but it is right in the middle of the city can t have everything ,0
 Door to door with garbage recycling factory It is in fact a motel not a hotel in the middle of industrial nowhere ,0
 the rooms should have a fridge the bathroom in the middle of the hotel is only ideal for couples but not two individuals who are just friends some sockets and lights werent working in my room the towels in the room were not changed after the first night,0
 we ate in our room the first night and meat was under cooked after asking for it to be cooked well done Fruit salad consisted of only three fruits the melon was either hard or over ripe ,0
 The price of breakfast 22 50 euro and the price of parking the car 35 euros a day Ridiculous prices,0
 There was a strange smell in the room and in the hotel,0
 Most Horrible hotel they gave me a room on 3rd floor with no Lift I have to climb 3 floors and rooms were available on ground 1st floor and 2nd floor and I requested them so much they didn t agree to give the room on lover floor The rooms are so tiny you cant even move your self I will never recommend any one for this hotel not at all worth for money ,0
 Buffet breakfast could have been better ,0
 Noisy accommodation fan and lights were very intrusie beds were not comfortable,0
 The bathroom was very small,0
 An actual double bed not two beds pushed together,0
 Wifi is very hit and miss Works in the bathroom but struggles in the actual room Only two elevators servicing the entire hotel leads to problems during the busy times ,0
 Small shower only 1 elevator at the hotel and wifi reception was average at best ,0
 Facility was not as updated as pictures suggest ,0
 The only thing I would comment on is when dining in the evening the young lady that was waiting on us was chewing gum Don t get me wrong she was very good at her job but the chewing gum doesn t look good at all when in a restaurant ,0
 The bed had a wooden headboard that had been treated with some kind of oil or lacquer that smelled quite bad They should be more careful when putting treated wood products in the rooms ,0
 the scrambled eggs were the worst I ve ever had ,0
 The lift was tiny but functional ,0
 Only that one must take public transport to go anywhere in Vienna ,0
 Breakfast should be included with the rooms ,0
 Very expensive but you got what you paid for Breakfast could have been included ,0
 The price was high and I thought I would have at least a fair quality for the money paid The hotel is rated 4 star and i hardly can give it 2 star well it was at same quality as london B B and maybe less The place was dirty I found traces of cockroaches wings on my room floor and it has only one elevator and there is no parking for the car It was a bad experience I don t recommend anyone to stay there,0
 Room should have drawers and a larger wardrobe,0
 Room staff sorry but lack of attention to detail each day twice forgot to leave sufficient towels daily forgot to replace Tea bags often did not remove dirty dishes often did not replace water Small details but importantant ,0
 The prostitutes outside the hotel shouting to each other until 4am wasn t really helpful Room was very very small for the money about twice the size of the double bed and that was after an upgrade from a tinier box room ,0
 Cumberland sausages are not great Toast station needs to be moved away from the corner of the breakfast room as it gets very congested with people trying to get to the pastries jam and toaster The bed was a bit too firm but it s OK Lighting levels in the room are poor without both bedside lights being on The TV starts with a load of corporate blurb high volume and finding how to switch it off and get the TV on was not easy Also when selecting the TV guide it always came up with lots of no information against the channels so it was difficult to find anything as each channel had to be selected before you could see what was on ,0
 The Manager has already received an email from me I await his response,0
 The food setved t the fullers pub was not a good standard and over priced ,0
 No communication between hotel and the booking com non of our requests were taken into account and eventhough we booked a room for 2 adults and one child we were provided with room with only one bed Reception staff was highly unprofessional all trainees who provided us at first a matreess to put on the floor for our 8 year old daughter When we finally got to a proper reception staff who was very professional we finally got the room we were supposed to get However this has spoiled our experience completely Parking is outrageously expensive 36 eur day ,0
 Location of hotel required walking to tube and train to access west end,0
 The food was not very hot and the cost of the evening meal and breakfast was quite expensive ,0
 Will be booking again soon no dislike ,0
 If I had to say something negative it would be that room was on the small side so not big enough to really sit and relax in The rest of the hotel spaces were great for relaxation and comfort so more than made up for the room size ,0
 cleanlniness,0
 The pool was very small ,0
 I was on a work trip and had to work from my hotel room at some points but the wifi was very weak and I could not send emails ,0
 While Ethernet was incredibly fast WiFi was poor in our room ,0
 The area to cross for reaching the metro station was not pleasant ,0
 A stiffer bed,0
 The room I was saying was directly under the stairs and I could hear every footstep I didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance I would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through ,0
 We like the service of the staf,0
 Everything,0
 The lack of storage and clothes hooks was a real problem and yet so easy to fix it would take no time and cost so little yet without these it was a real issue Please sort this out ,0
 The bed wasn t very comfortable ,0
 Prices for coffee in the lounge was as expensive as a pint of Guinness ,0
 We had stayed 2 nights and are plans had changed We asked for 3 more nights and the rate was so different from check in agents that I don t know what was a good rate or not Thought also the rate was a little high for location Then they also made me pay in full at that time Never had to do that before ,0
 The rooms were tiny There was little lighting in the room and it appeared that there were too separate sides of the hotel one for commoners and one for the people who were paying more I m not sure how much more because I was spending 350 Definitely not worth its money ,0
 I got the hotel at a great price But in general the price has been really hiked up since it was taken over and refurbed Also no movie package anymore That used to be a perfect compliment to a hangover in the hoxton ,0
 The location even though In a beautiful zone and In front of a tram station is approximately 25 30 mins far from the centre ,0
 The hotel was really modern It was clean and really comfortable The staff were so friendly and help full The hotel was also located beside a really good transport system which made it easy to get around,0
 Breakfast expensive Fitness access early morning need a new key everyday,0
 You hear every word of the people next door If those were party peiple you will not sleep,0
 Breakfast and dinner were a mess staff always seemed annoyed had to fight through other guests to get food charged 5 euro for water and would not let tomorrow bring your own ,0
 Too big to be cosy ,0
 Restaurant and bar facilities poor ,0
 The room which was booked as superior twin was a bit too small,0
 We had the breakfast the first morning But quite boring and quite expensive considering there are some great little bakeries with fantastic food ,0
 rooms are very old and dirty ,0
 I requested a wake up call that didn t come my TV didn t work properly I reported it but no one came to fix it that I know of At check out I spoke to the guest rep and she apologized and said she would look into it and email me Upon my return to the States I had an email stating they would upgrade me to a more expensive room on my next visit Well that s all well and good but I m not planning a return visit and if she had asked me she would have known that This was my most costly booking and to be fair given the location I think it was relatively inexpensive but in retrospect I enjoyed my stays in smaller guest houses where the host and hostess really go out of their way to make you feel at home and provide you with whatever you need and in all cases with less means ,0
 We had to wait like 10 minutes as there wasn t anyone at front desk when I got to hotel Plus we found our card details laying on the front desk Was really shocked There was only 1person working so maybe had to do something ,0
 still expensive,0
 Breakfast buffet need to be enhanced,0
 There was no GYM ,0
 Not much to complain about Room size was small C London after all but everything was fairly efficiently designed ,0
 Siz of the room the smell was not good as well ,0
 The room was on the small size for the price ,0
 Price of breakfast,0
 Quibble quibble quibble Honestly where does this negative energy direct one other than a roller coaster ride to the road to nowhere To improve and enhance is an ordainment but let us also not take those gestures of kindness as our birth right Listen to that voice from within This universe of ours along with its myriad imperfections will seem a celebration then Italy is one such place as is Spain That Latino spirit with seemingly endless dimension enough to embrace eternity within its fold ,0
 The front desk could be more welcoming Smile goes a long way ,0
 Cost in conference day,0
 Room was a little tired however they are being redecorated during AW 2016 17 Breakfast poor value ,0
 room little bit small for three persons,0
 Room was quite small and a little worn,0
 Terrace restaurant very expensive but good views ,0
 Maybe the costs of staying there its a little bit expensive now,0
 Lack of room service past 9pm,0
 Only slight issue was the Doors of rooms are quite loud when they close so we kept hearing doors shutting early in the morning ,0
 Price is slightly on the higher side but you get what you pay for ,0
 Was in the annex and we were unable to open door It was laborious having to ask the reception to open our door every time who also took minutes to get in Would prefer breakfast to served until 10 rather then 9 30 No room to change in when your room isn t ready so had to use the smallest WC ,0
 Room was very small and had a small staircase up to the bed,0
 Very far from the center and scary neighbourhood and no parking place,0
 The room wasn t very clean Dirty ceilings old food in the mini fridge ,0
 We booked the hotel as room was advertised for 3 people and as having 3 single beds suitable for a holiday for myself and 2 friends The room actually only had 2 single beds and a small camp bed more suitable for a child The room was made up for 2 adults with 2 mugs towels toiletries etc The hotel staff cleanliness and breakfast was all very good but I feel it was wrongly advertised on booking com,0
 The room size was very small as compared to the one shown in the pictures left me disappointed ,0
 Genuinely can t think of anything,0
 The times the rooms were getting cleaned I found that it was way too early I had a knock on the door Sunday morning at 9a m while I was getting for breakfast and on my arrival day after just getting into the room they were knocking to come in to clean after it had already been cleaned for check in ,0
 Close to Termini ,0
 We had to queue for about half an hour to check in because of a group were checking in ahead of us Eventually another member of reception staff came out who helped book us in quickly after that Rooms are lovely and comfortable but the walls are a bit thin We could hear what was going on in next door s bathroom ,0
 Was too dirty,0
 The look and feel of the hotel is very oldfashioned The bathroom needs refurbishment And there were no soap bodylotion complementary water and hotel slippers present I have stayed in three stat hotels that are more modern and do provide these extra little things ,0
 the only thing I didn t like was the concierge services concierge took for ever to get our bags when we were checking out concierge didn t weigh our bags when we requested it took him 1 hour to do so ,0
 Renovations meant that there is dust all through the lobby and conference area It has triggered terrible asthma and I am now unwell ,0
 The fact my room was 149 but 199 was taken from my account pending and it s still showing as pending leaving me 50 short Not cool ,0
 A bit old Needs some refurbishment ,0
 Air con unit rattled a bit ,0
 Chandeliers in 1910 room breakfast room were incongruent with architecture ,0
 The photo was a little off for the mezzanine suite It showed the master bed on the ground floor in front of the tv with the couch upstairs in loft Not a huge deal but we like to go to sleep with the tv on Luckily i brought my iPad Breakfast was a little pricey but delicious ,0
 I missed the more healthy type of foods from the breakfast selection eg whole grain bakery or wider range of vegetables Although the room was comfortable but I missed that there were limited storage places where we could put our baggage and clothes It was also the case in the bathroom ,0
 1 The clerk male at reception was rather rude indifferent at best At every other hotel the staff were beaming and bending over backwards to help It was NOT a good introduction to the hotel 2 The bed was uncomfortable it sank into the middle 3 The air conditioning was very noisy 4 The breakfast was way overpriced NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WON T BE STAYING HERE AGAIN ,0
 Room was tiny desk chair was atrocious Restaurant service was non existent we were ignored most of the time Choice of cereals at breakfast very poor ,0
 TV channels doesn t match the TV card menu ,0
 Breakfast is very limited and no tea and coffee facilities in the room Seems as though room service is also always closed You should improve this ,0
 Never managed to adjust the temperature of the water in the shower as usual in Paris ,0
 Breakfast very poor cold one day and the next all the juices had been watered down Pool really worn down no spa pool as advertised ,0
 Not many places open in the surrounding area near hotel at weekends you do need to travel to a different part of the city for entertainment,0
 Room too small for family of five Pool sometimes children not allowed,0
 Breakfast was too much expensive Not enough free bikes when we arrived they were all finished ,0
 Very few staff members spoke English as their first language which made expressing our needs very difficult The night manager was argumentative rude and unhelpful ,0
 room size,0
 It would be nit picking to criticise anything ,0
 Just my personal preference but I would have preferred a proper shower rather than a shower over the bath with a shower curtain ,0
 Phone didn t work but it was solved ,0
 Towels are old,0
 Unfriendly staff They never liked to help Every day there must be something is missing no shower gel or no coffee or no body lotion or no face towels or no water bottles This happened daily through the 9 nights I stayed there Also staff are unfriendly and unhelpful at all One time when I needed some help in calling international call the receptionist was too rude I was also surprised to see booking com modifying my previous review on this hotel and gave 10 while I gave negative comments This shows un honestly from booking com when it comes to the reviews Very surprising,0
 The bathroom was a little small but very nice The mini fridge in the room did not work well ,0
 no dining and bar very poorly stocked,0
 changed three rooms during our stay one had problems with the heating another with hot water,0
 Cold room especially bathroom quite noisy on the roads,0
 The rooms are very average,0
 Booked a lower ground room with a c Initially put in bedsit type room down the road from the main building in 3rd floor no lift and no a c on a warm day Had to ask to be moved ,0
 I don t fine the value for money,0
 Free breakfast,0
 6 stairs straighr down into the room from the door If you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book ,0
 Room could have been a little bit cleaner ,0
 The single rooms are far too small to be comfortable despite the nice decor and the room rate was over the top ,0
 For us the Location could have been better but not too bad With cases it s a fair walk from the tube Nevertheless it is a city centre hotel ,0
 Air conditioning was advertised but it was not switched on I asked about it it was out of season but we were there early April and it was quite warm ,0
 The time you can get alcohol from the executive lounge was a bit short 2hours only ,0
 They over charged me by 336 and have still not refunded me the money or replied to my email ,0
 Was a little pricey but we enjoyed our stay,0
 No heating in hotel room had to use the hairdryer to warm the room up ,0
 The rate,0
 Swimming pool noisy and full of children no loungers available any time of stay small complaint really,0
 The price was a little high but still good for London so can t be fussy,0
 On the Saturday night there was a private function and the music was so loud we were kept awake until past 1 am There was no warning that this would be the case and the staff couldn t do anything to help in this matter ,0
 Too old furnishings and too low quality of hotel for such high price,0
 Staff very unfriendly,0
 Can t think of anything ,0
 No bar so would have to go out if you fancied a drink but this is not what this place is about ,0
 The room was in the basement ,0
 More breakfast choice like English breakfast,0
 I had to leave,0
 Very sm ll and stuffy room you can feel stuffy air every time you come to room old furniture and wallpaper bad air condition,0
 There wase a very disturbing noise in the rooms They told us that they are aware of it it is coming from the central air condition system s compressors and can t be shut down Changed three rooms Only the final room was a recently renovated room and quiet Hotel in general needs serious renovation ,0
 Art or decor in the room just to make it look a bit more inviting,0
 I don t think anything could have been improved on ,0
 Breakfast,0
 The room was smaller than my garden shed It would have been too small for me on my own and I am petit but was ridiculous for two of us The bathroom was no better You could sit on the toilet wash your feet in the shower and wash your hands in the sink all at the same time We were offered the option to upgrade to a suite albeit more money but it was like being in a cellar okay a bit moe room but no natural daylight So we stuck with the shoe box room ,0
 Lift not working though I think they have fixed it Cleaners did not hoover room during stay Room is very poorly lit and is in need of a make over updating Tv is small and old and only a handful of channels Even the cheapest tv s today have freeview The manager she walks around barefoot and the staff talk in their language over the guests You can here them arguing during day ,0
 Not sure if one can hear the upsatirs neighbours but it was not a problem for me on the top floor ,0
 They had a happy half hour but seemed a bit tight and not really relaxing Better to not have it or extend it to an hour to tempt people to stay,0
 High cost per night ,0
 Bathroom door made of class no privacy,0
 the door to the toilet in the room is a sliding door and it does not provide any privacy since it is not soundproof at all we had troubles connecting wi fi in the room sometimes however if one manages to connect it works pretty stable,0
 1 We were travelling with a baby and asked for a quiet room when booking our room was just next to the 3 lifts 2 We arrived 1 hour before the end of the breakfast and half of the buffet was empty no fruits but apples no croissants anymore ,0
 Not one thing ,0
 I cant think of anything bad or lousy of course they could spare a pair of throw away slippers which we always need and a bath robe yes,0
 Restaurant should be improved,0
 Fire alarm test at 6 45 and we asked for two single beds at booking and got a double Ran out of food we wanted at the bar ,0
 Room service is below my expectation,0
 N A,0
 very expensive and they deduct money from credit card although we paid cash ,0
 When we arrived we checked in and the room wasn t ready even though it was past check in time We waited quite a while for staff to come and deal with it This wasn t ideal as after travelling we just wanted to get changed and relax We complained and were offered a room with a king bed which we didn t want as we are two friends we had booked a twin room This wasn t any good so we said we d wait for the room to be cleaned It took a while before a member of staff offered us a seat downstairs in the bar area and a complimentary drink We went and waited around 10 mins and nobody came to ask us what we wanted the place seemed deserted Eventually we got our drinks brought up to the room but it took at least 20 mins Then we were asked to sign for them to go on the bill the message had obviously not been passed on that they were free of charge This was sorted quickly though We then asked for an iron and waited ages then a member of staff came up to inform us that there was no iron available so we couldn t have one It seemed other guests were using them so it was fair enough just a shame they didn t have more to go around Initially it was a slightly disappointing start to the stay as we were expecting super service due to all the excellent reviews and the cost to stay there but after these initial problems were ironed out the rest of the stay was problem free ,0
 Housekeeping knocking on the door at 9am when checkout is 11am and I had a do not disturb sign on the door,0
 The bathroom is very small and not entirely renovated The Wi Fi has a very low signal The room has no espresso machine like other 4 star hotel rooms do We had no mini bar in the room We also didn t have slippers in the room and had to ask for them There aren t any parking spaces in the area that you can use as most of them are reserved only for the residents and the disabled We parked on the street and 2 hours later when we returned to the car we had a fine on the windscreen as we didn t know about the restrictions of the parking at first and the receptionist didn t warn us about them he simply said that we could park on the street and pay the public parking fees The room was not soundproof ,0
 Uncomfortable beds ,0
 Time to checl in and to receive the room ,0
 There should be more than one English speaking television channel,0
 Breakfast choices are limited,0
 The room was very small and also there was significant noise which sounded like a hoover but I think was the extraction fan I complained but did not feel I was taking seriously,0
 The bacon on the bap was too salty Possibly a bacon and egg bap would be more nourishing ,0
 not very quiet in the midnight,0
 Room was way too small We could hardly put our luggage anywhere ,0
 Temperature in the room was very warm and also throughout the hotel ,0
 Wifi is a bit slow Maybe minor refurbishments ,0
 The size of the room was small and the bed was right up against the window which meant that one of us got a little chilly It was a surprise to find that we had to pay extra for the gym and spa ,0
 too dark room At Sunday morning breakfast the staff was a mess under organized although there were enough people to manage The process and guest management failed big time Stress test f ailed It was a mess ,0
 Side tables are beautiful but not child friendly made of heavy metal Although its heavy but it has unsteady base could be the weight of the flat top surface My daughter was nearly hit twice God only knows if it did coz it will certainly crushed her little feet It s a safety hazard for kids ,0
 I didn t like the bathroom because it was for disable because the hotel was fully booked but I had a bedroom with amazing view so I didn t mind nit to have a bath in the bathroom ,0
 THOUGHT ROOM RATE WAS EXCESSIVE AND GLAD BREAKFAST 24 WAS INCLUDED IN ROOM RATE,0
 The original room was not ready on arrival so they offered the deal to upgrade I think they probably offer this to everyone who arrives early and is definitely a sales technique targeting weary travellers ,0
 The air conditioning was very noisy The staff had to turn it off at the mains ,0
 Expensive in room breakfast,0
 Decor is a little dated and tired ,0
 That we had to leave ,0
 The toilet was separated from the bathroom with no hand washing facilities in it ,0
 Found two members of the Spa very rude on Sunday evening whilst trying to gain entry to the Swimming pool They were abrupt and rude ,0
 Would like breakfast included in the price,0
 Every thing,0
 Our room was 7th floor and there was noise from the roof bar of 8th floor ,0
 Cost for breakfast is high and probably not worth it as there are many great places to eat around the hotel ,0
 It was a mess under the bed on the floor ,0
 The pillow and a water boiler in room would be great ,0
 NO,0
 It was unfortunate that my visit coincided with the upgrade of the hotel meaning accessing the entrance area was on some occasions quite dangerous,0
 Lots of noise coming out of the heating air condition system in the room basement impossible to sleep,0
 Not a thing ,0
 My daughter and I found the pillows a bit on the hard side but that s all I have ,0
 Decor theme to strange for me,0
 noway of controling room temperature ,0
 No complaints ,0
 Very crowded at breakfast,0
 No windows in the room only those looking inside the hotel hall because of which the room was bit too dark for me,0
 I did not stay long enough,0
 The decorations and carpet in the corridors to the rooms were very tired and in need of updating or a good clean It was a concern walking to the room as to what we would be greeted with but the room was amazing and very modern ,0
 Rushed staff too dark rooms and restaurant breakfast bag didn t show up noisy corridors wake up call that I hadn t booked ,0
 It was all good,0
 Not a lot of breakfast choices and a little away from city centre ,0
 Insufficient milk cartons in room Bar prices,0
 Minor really but at Breakfast I did ask for poached eggs on brown bread but I got poached eggs that were not cooked and on white bread just a note to the chef to be a little more careful but the staff were great in the restaurant and so it didn t deter from my enjoyment,0
 Husbands birthday weekend Added this to the notes on the booking and that it was a surprise weekend Thought it may at least have been mentioned maybe an upgrade or fruit in room or something anything Nope No mention Disappointed after such great views on here Wasn t made to feel special or unique just another guest ,0
 The aircon wasn t the best ,0
 The internet access is free but runs through a portal that requires you to log in and jump through a few hoops every time you check in again Very tedious and not very fast either ,0
 Room decor Price of breakfast Quality of breakfast,0
 Price,0
 None,0
 3 floor room was warm although there was an air cooler it would have beneficial to be able to open the window ,0
 Not adequate heating and no ventilation in the bathroom,0
 Location Old room decoration facilities Far from center,0
 For muslim people breakfast is poor there is no halal food so we ate only cheese and scrambled egg price is little bit higher,0
 I miss the foliage all out the front Bar staff seemed pretty depressed D,0
 That I haven t stayed there before now,0
 Overall poor room Internet I didn t like and I ll not recommended the hotel is not worthy the money ,0
 The room was too hot even after the temperature had been altered,0
 I couldn t get a table for dinner because the restaurant was booked out at least 24 hours in advance ,0
 The AC didnt work the staff told us that they can help us change the hotel but they cant fix the AC we were tired so we just slept there with the windows open Worst 4 star hotel ever If you go there make sure you check the rooms before hand They charged us a week ago for the booking and yet they didnt care or checked the room before we checked in The staff is really slow too ,0
 The service at the Restaurant Bar was not that good ,0
 Well the beds could be movable we booked a triple room with 3 separate beds but 2 beds were still fixed next to each other as if it was a double Coffee machine was moody at times just spitting the pads out Could not use the loyalty points card Other than that no comments ,0
 Lot of passage ways to go through before getting to lift,0
 This time I was on second floor and one floor above was very loud and I couldnt sleep well I woke up at least 5 times over a night ,0
 A little cold at night because I did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning My own fault but the print is small ,0
 We did not pay for WIFI as we felt this should be available to those who had booked a room without paying an additional cost ,0
 The room was really cold then really hot ,0
 A warm welcome would have been better than a warm cookie the worst reception staff I have ever encountered I asked for a room with a view confirmed on the booking No room with a view I booked a car parking space no car parking space Apparently I have to understand the hotel was fully booked and very busy not for long if you carry on like this ,0
 The room was very small The bathroom was tiny narrow and not user friendly ,0
 I booked this hotel for my two very senior colleagues on a business trip because it was close to the bullet train station the office they were visiting It seemed bigger than the average size a 4 stars hotel and had good reviews After the first night they asked me to move them to another hotel as there were all kinds of small but inconvenient issues the air con appeared to be working but the room was not getting any cooler shower had low pressure the room seemed a bit outdated breakfast wasn t nice etc I had two rooms booked for 4 days one of them a suite I asked the hotel to cancel the other 3 nights and keep one night as cancelation fee that s the policy if you cancel less than 24 hours before the stay and on booking com it appeared that it can be cancelld anytime if you pay one night Print screen attached They refused saying we can check out but pay the remaining 3 nights for each of the rooms I sent emails to Booking com with print screen of the reservation that seems to show this cancelation policy they did not have ANY answer They just encouraged me to take photos of the room so we can convince the hotel that the room is inappropiate I can t really take photos of shower pressure and temperature My boss who was actually staying at the hotel had business meetings all day and didn t want to interact with them so he asked me his PA to negotiate with the hotel I made the booking from my account I handle all his travelling arrangements especially abroad outside Japan The hotel refused the request because the person actually staying in the room did not report directly despite telling them many times through the Booking com customer center that I m their assistant who made the booking the people actually staying don t have the available time foreign language ability disponibility to negotiate with them ,0
 Price,0
 Not personal no turn down service ,0
 I don t recommend this hotel for allergic people The carpets are highly allergic We stayed only one night but we suffered from allergic symptoms For this reason I would not stay here again ,0
 Didn t like how when we got back to the hotel you couldn t purchase anything with cash had to be card Although recpetion did order us a dominos which had in our room ,0
 Bed uncomfortable Room TINY No wifi signal Noisy Terrible experience,0
 Even though you had air con it was very hot in hotel no windows could be opened ,0
 Reception was small and too busy I needed parking and the only available was unsecure parking at some distance There is no where to sit outside to have a drink,0
 Asked for early check in and a quite room as my wife needs rests during the day arrived and was told no rooms available before 2pm then given one at the back of the hotel right next to a very busy main rail route with constant train noise and room was very hot so had to keep the window open as air conditioner was very noisy so had nearly no sleep mentioned this when checking out and got no apology or recognition that there was something wrong Breakfast was over priced for what was on offer won t be staying there again We felt we were brushed off by the staff when checking in and when discussing the room at check out ,0
 mattess acoustic isolation,0
 Room was good halls are starting to get outdated need a good carpet cleaning ,0
 Very small room probably the smallest i ve ever stayed in I expected more from a four star hotel to be honest,0
 Wifi in rooms is charged extra ,0
 Subteranean breakfast room,0
 Internet connection in our room,0
 My only criticism is that there were no high back comfortable seating in the waiting area by the reception The two existing low red chairs are a joke a child might consider sitting in one but no adult ,0
 No complaints would ve been great if the kitchen had a toaster though ,0
 not all facilities available as described on website,0
 Very noisy with some vibrations in the room ,0
 Toilets made a loud noise when flushing shower was a bit week,0
 Bad smell in bedroom overpowering lemon scent in bathroom Bathroom generally tatty Long queue for check in Constant up selling of extras very annoying ,0
 Noise children,0
 Bed was hard hurts the back Gym only had three cardio equipments,0
 A bit noisy at night especially from the passing boats that set music out loud Quite far to nearest attractions such as Van Gogh museum Rijk Museum Heineken Museum etc ,0
 Wifi tempermental,0
 The got wrong my order in the room service ,0
 the noise from St pauls chiming clock might unsettle some in rooms at the front of the property,0
 As we were on the ramblas it was quite noisy at night,0
 Initially room was too small and when I demanded a better room I was charged extra 35 per day which I thing was too much,0
 We were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back We never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment ,0
 TV in a room had hard time working but this is not very important so doesn t really matter that much The bathroom could be a bit bigger more space to put cosmetics ,0
 More choice cereals breakfast,0
 Rooms and beds they put two beds together I bought double bed they were renovating some rooms Hence we couldn t get good sleep ,0
 Put the coffee and tea making in a more open space not the cupboard ,0
 The bathroom felt like a hospital,0
 Bed not fixed together it was two beds pushed together,0
 I didn t get the room I booked till end of the day Always request to see the room before checking in as the reciptibist will always tell I checked you in a lovely room The first room they tried to stick me in had a no door no walls cabinet it was badly designed I couldn t open the drawers they hit the bed table,0
 Very small room very small bed very small bathroom,0
 The staff looked that they were too overwhelmed We had to wait in line for 30 minutes to check in And mainly it is way too overpriced ,0
 Beds hard staff not always polite,0
 Lighting in the bathroom for make up ,0
 n a,0
 Sunday breakfast was a little busy but hardly the end of the world ,0
 I found the bed and pillows a bit hard for my liking but everyone s preferences are different ,0
 Hotel billed my credit card twice in error emailed them yesterday to resolve haven t heard back yet ,0
 Friendlier staff in coffee shop,0
 Our room had no external view but that was not too disappointing we spent most of our time in the city ,0
 We were disappointed with the executive suite very small window opened out on to the service yard not at all executive The room service was VERY poor It took three attempts to get the basics of a very simple order any where near correct We ordered a Afternoon Tea which was supposed to consist of a selection of sandwiches and cakes along with cream scones and strawberry preserve we got two scones and cream no preserve no knifes no milk when eventually preserve was brought it was marmalade at which stage we just gave up There was a lot of noise throughout the night people running up and down the corridor and slamming doors ,0
 The spa area and restaurant Rooms are lovely too ,0
 There was not really anything we didn t like ,0
 I spilt a cup of coffee on my quilt the first night of my stay and the quilt was never changed for the remaining five nights Went without toilet paper for two days and facial tissue box was empty for my entire stay and floor was never vacuumed Very disappointing to sleep on same sheets and quilt for a six night stay and use hand towels for toilet paper and to blow my noise This is understandable for a third world country Not Amsterdam Price for breakfast buffet was extremely high and food choices remained the same with NO variance ,0
 The only thing was you could hear the toilet flushing next door and above us but that was not a big problem ,0
 Shower wasn t powerful enough Incomprehensible TV internet At these prices a completely self service buffet breakfast isn t really good enough ,0
 Road noise,0
 Didn t like the lift card system,0
 Bit far out after midnight when the tube closed its a pricey taxi ride ,0
 hot dishes at breakfast could do with more variety and better quality the hotel is located 15 min walk from the Navigli canal which is not very close ,0
 Your staff could be more insightful on recommendations tips and they could generally be more interactive with guests ,0
 the location is about 10 minutes away from the centre,0
 Significant differences between the ordered and received room a city view room paid but I receiving for a room overlooking the inner courtyard What I paid Air Conditioning Private bathroom City view Free WiFi What I got The city instead of first checking out a few office buildings and metal pipes near the window that s not a good start The hop on hop off bus and or a city view room synonymous with the city view I see this Image inside oom and outside in hotel area ,0
 Took a while to get tea and coffee in the morning at breakfast but apart from that not much to complain about ,0
 Long walk to the bedrooms and as they had external windows the corridors were very cold ,0
 The room was small although this was expected in London The shower flooded the bathroom every time it was used although we were able to use towels to stop this it was a small annoyance The ice machine on our level did not work It was advised that there was a menu in the room for room service there was not The room was cold even the heating was cold The second night I ended up using a towel as an extra layer in bed The duvet didn t stretch over the two of us and my partner slept with the sheet as the duvet didn t completely fill the bedding The bed felt cheap but was okay Our main complaint is with dinner We entered the more relaxed bar for dinner and sat down and noticed everyone around us not too busy was receiving table service We waited and waited for someone to take our drink order no one even said hello After waiting 10 minutes my partner went to the bar and ordered our drinks and also requested a menu and advised the staff that we eating Our drinks were brought over to us while we decided what to eat Again we waited and waited and no one came to take our order even though we had been told that they would My partner again got up and tried to order a few moments later the supervisor came and took our order We ordered two pricey steaks I thought after this we would be taken more seriously We were warned of the 35 minute wait on food and this was fine When our food was brought to us I don t think that the waiter could have got away even faster if he tried We were offered no condiments at all My partner again had to get up and ask for salt I had ordered my steak medium rare I know this offends some people but I hate blood in my food This apparently offended the chef as my steak was more Medium Rare No one came to check if everything was okay with our food and by this point we had just given up on the service ,0
 paid wifi in rooms just add it to the room price and let me forget about asking how to connect and payment process,0
 The staff was just unpleasant The stairs 3 floors with no help from the staff This place is far from any tube station ,0
 Thought breakfast included whereas cost 108 3 night stay ,0
 We arrived 2 hours before our check in I had told the hotel this Polite staff BUT I think it would have been really nice if we had been offered a drink whilst we waited for our room on the house This is the case in top US hotels ,0
 Because this hotel is located in Rambrandt square Rambrandtplein lt had a liitle noisy at night ,0
 It would have been nice to have more hot coffee at breakfast the room safe and hairdryer did not work but i am sure they would have fixed these things had i been bothered i had no complaints really it was lovely ,0
 It would be hard to say what we didn t like in only 2 3 sentences This hotel is definitely not a 3 and a half to 4 star as listed Awful ,0
 Have to be careful walking out their front door They have a narrow sidewalk that pedestrians and bikers use Almost got hit by a bicyclist stepping out their front door ,0
 Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,0
 N A,0
 This hotel property is located in a suburb of Milan about a 30 minute trolley car ride to the city center For the d cor location and services provided I thought it was a bit pricey If I was rating it by German hotel standards I would put it somewhere between standard and first class that is about 3 5 stars ,0
 Paying for wifi this should be included ,0
 The only let down was the breakfast on Arriveing at the dining room at 9am the breakfast was all over cooked stood standing 5 mins before somebody came a threw a load of over cooked greasy bacon in the tray had to asked for our tea twice sorry it was let down ,0
 To far out of London long walk to tube,0
 In principle I should admit this trip in particular we had no problems what so ever ,0
 The bed matrix The btrakfast is not rich no facilities,0
 Pricy After reading super high reviews expected to be blown away Lobby was spectacular but room was a little musty dated ,0
 Our bed was 2 beds pushed together,0
 The AC did not cool our room enough We were told the technician would take a look only to be later told it should work Luckily it was cool outside and we opened the windows Internet included in room rate is rather slow Room was cleaned well but cleaning of floor especially under the bed did not seem to be done well Housekeeping also came to make up room rather late in the day ,0
 Room a bit cold when coming back from the city ,0
 Maybe English language newspapers Also the travel tickets and combinations could be better explained although this is not really the hotels job it would help as Vienna has GREAT transport but needs mastering ,0
 Breackfast had a low quality,0
 Rooms are small Ideal for no more than 2 ppl Having a baby in the room makes it quite tight for space ,0
 Smoking smile every where except the lobby ,0
 There was construction next door which resulted in very early drilling 6am and loud banging This was no fault of the hotel but was very disruptive in the morning and prevented a sleep in Otherwise no complaints,0
 The bath in the room was terrible There was no way you could relax in it even my wife who is 5ft 7in found it uncomfortable,0
 Room very small,0
 Lifts are very small and long queue for breakfast,0

 The room service was bad ordered a coffee that was lukewarm then ordered chilly and jacket potato worse my partner had ever eaten half of the music channel on the tv never worked and we paid for late check out and 3 different people knocked our door and 1 lady try to come in our room and the full English breakfast was poor and the toiletries was half full good job we had our own,0
 Breakfast was only average Bedroom was basic bed wasn t very comfortable,0
 N A,0
 The cleanliness of the room was disappointing we found hair in our bed and in the bathtub The toilet had a brown stain around the rim of the seat and the air conditioning didn t seem to work properly so we ended up sleeping on top of the bed all night ,0
 The rooms are small That s a typical feature of hotels near Paddington of course ,0
 The view from our window was bad for the price and the mattress was hard so didn sleep very well,0
 Couldn t get into roof bar or downstairs Too busy ,0
 only problem was parking It would help if you could include in the details the nearest convenient public parking,0
 Service at restaurant is bad Location is far from center but close to arena ,0
 Felt like staying in ikea for the night Rooms are not well lit,0
 Rooms at the front on the Strand are noisy,0
 the TV in the sitting area away from bed didnt work we were told it would be fixed the next day but that didn t happen My husband was very upset and the maid left us with not towels on the same day ,0
 Noise at night from neighbouring room No bedside light ,0
 Needs better soundproofing in the rooms You can hear everyone in the internal corridors and stairwells as well as adjoining rooms We were warned about the noise from public and external areas but even quieter alleyways were quite echoey Choose an internal room if possible We had to keep the window open at night as the aircon did not cool the room it only heated ,0
 The first room also business we were given low ceiling weird shape mezzanine type with inclined window little light And it was an interconnected room,0
 Narrow rooms unfriendly staff,0
 I was very disappointed with the hotel It was old and in need of renovation The bathroom door was peeling and the window wouldn t shut properly I was very sad that the Hilton didn t live up to my expectations,0
 Cold bathroom not even a heated towel rail brrrr,0

 Parking entrance and exit is too small I have to be very careful not to scratch my car ,0
 1 They need to decide if the are a student housing or a hotel 2 The service is very bad for hotel But for student housing is ok 3 There is no room service but there is a menu food in the room That s confusing 4 Housekeeping is bad they forgot to change towels and they did not change the bed sheet on the whole stay 5 You can not put restaurants check in the room even the restaurant the pool being inside the hotel 6 The walls between rooms are paper thin you can listen every single noise of next door guest,0
 Cleanliness needs more attention,0
 we lost some stuff from the room,0
 Dirty grubby room furniture in disrepair ect,0
 The rooms on the top floor sometimes have a poor satalite TV connection,0
 Bathroom didn t have hair conditioner,0

 Temperature was a little cool ,0
 No much space in the room,0
 Walls aren t great you can hear what is going on in the room next to you ,0
 It looks like the bar is the primary business with the hotel lodge being more a side business if you want to check in you have to enter the pub and ask the Bartender its just a bit strange Its a bit too expensive for the room I got looking at the emergency plan I noticed I got the smallest room No bathtub in my room,0
 A bit too expensive,0
 For the same money you get more in other places but do not know if that could happen in London ,0
 Taxi from airport has a minimum 30 charge Once you know bus routes it s much cheaper and easier,0
 Staff was not very responsive There was a weird smell at the bathroom but when I asked for someone to check which took half an hour to come he simply said he couldn t smell anything Another morning I asked for towels and they could come only after 40 minutes ,0
 Slightly noisy and several light bulbs in room did not work Room a little shabby in places ,0
 The breakfast,0
 Our room was without a window and it was very cold Would stay here again but upgrade to a more premium room given the chance,0
 The shower has some grime in it however I could still wash ,0
 Indiferent eesign Far from being a 5 star Delays everywhere Check out baggage storage Problems technical took forever to solve,0
 The tiles in the bathroom looked like they hadnt been cleaned in weeks The heater was blowing cold air regardless the setting it was on The shower head was dirty,0
 Breakfast could have been continental OR full ie continental only The food itself was very good quality but not everyone can eat a full breakfast and 20 is expensive for a continental breakfast ,0
 The pool water did not look very clear so we skipped the idea of a swim but the hotel overall we thought was lovely ,0
 very basic room Thin towels No soap ,0
 The room is a little bit dark because it is all in dark wooden It could be changed ,0
 Everything about this hotel was just perfect for us ,0
 That we couldn t stay longer,0
 Several English TV channels did not work,0
 No room service food,0
 we were given the wrong room on arrival the gym also does not look like the pictures you have on your website the rooms are also expensive for what you get a little run down ,0
 the room was service daily however it was not hoovered and cleaned the way I would have expected,0
 Far too noisy old windows that need to be replaced by windows better stopping the noise of the very busy traffic Old airco system continuously making noise even when switched off ,0
 Room In need of modernisation but exceptable,0
 I requested a bath tub when booking a long time ago but the room allocation was not selected till we arrived when no such facilities were available even if we up graded to a suite I am sure that at the time of booking availability would have been easy Staff very efficient but not happy or at ease with residents ,0
 Extremely small room only enough for one person with a small suitcase You won t literally be able to open a big suitcase ,0
 Bedrooms and bathrooms extremely small and no baths available throughout the hotel whatever category room you booked ,0
 Non functional towel rail in wet room,0
 Sofa bed as only option for children could have been more comfortable Would be great if they could fit two small singles or pull out beds in same space ,0
 Breakfast not included in price No facilities to make your own drinks Not including the foyer we found the other public areas very dark and depressing especially the Blind Spot which looked seedy and not the type of place for women The cost of ad hoc items very expensive e g a small glass of wine was 12 ,0
 Had requested twin beds which turned out to be two mattresses with one duvet and linen for the double In effect it was a double bed not twin beds ,0
 Noise from bar at night ,0
 When we arrive there was still building work going on in the room next door a drill was being used until 5pm on the Friday I personally don t think you should have guests stay while there is building work happening next door ,0
 WC is very small,0
 Air con in room was broken which made the room SO hot Once we opened the window we then couldnt really sleep due to how noisy traffic and passers by were Curtains are really thin also so it feels like people can see in if you have the light on and it is light during the night due to street lamps Breakfast was lovely the selection however the hot section wasnt kept heated We were the first down in the morning and it was already cold couldnt really enjoy totally cold egg sausages mushrooms etc I d also say it s a bit pricey 12 pp,0
 The room was small but comfortable Price is high Lobby is small ,0
 10 parking overnight ,0
 Small bed ,0
 Quality of staff seemed to vary at times they were very competent at other times other staff seemed unable to resolve simple issues It s a busy hotel and overall I think they were fine but this did get my attention ,0
 Corridors needs to be renovated ,0
 Just wish that they have better mattresses it was slightly uncomfortable to sleep on the bed ,0
 Firstly to get a fair picture of the actual room Secondly if they will offer a crappy room that is not on the pictures price it appropriately ,0
 The section where the bathroom is is a little bit to dark Putting makeup on is impossible although they offer a small illuminated mirror which in my case didn t work This could for sure be better we used the parking service of our car which costs 35 Euro per day When we arrived they asked us about the time we would like to have our car back When we decided to leave earlier because of the really bad weather they initially said it would take 1 5 2 hours until they would bring the car which they didn t said when we arrived It finally took only 1 hour and 15 minutes but still you have to know that in advance Comparing to other hotels where I have been I think it is a little bit overpriced but I think that in general hotels in Amsterdam are expensive,0
 For the price I paid I would ve expected a better room I ve paid 50 for better rooms at a Travellodge,0
 The room was very small and cramped,0
 The size of the room was a little small but for the price it was good,0
 Parking was too expensive hence empty compared to other hotels in Milan,0
 Door was a little touchy Tried not to wake entire hall,0
 Check in Could not get in room till 330 ,0
 location bad for real activities in London Spent too much time travelling too from property,0
 The opportunity for a great view from the patio if they weren t brick walls,0
 Too many tables in breakfast room Rooms were very small,0
 Our room was on the ground floor with windows facing a small back yard with a modern extension At night we were woken by noise made by some guests returning to their rooms in the extension The noise was as loud as if someone was talking in our room ,0
 Didn t like having to make my mind up the night before about whether to have breakfast the night to avoid paying extra,0
 I didn t book another night should have ,0
 Room is not sound prof you could her noises from other room Coffee in breakfast is not good,0
 Lift a bit temperamental,0
 Air conditioner wasn t working properly and was very noisy ,0
 Liked hotel much better than the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury we stayed in a few weeks ago We got a special price we would not pay what we think is the full price as the room would not be worth it ,0
 Small pool Sunbeds usually busy Poor light and view in rooms facing patio ,0
 You don t think that it is a four seasons hotel staff ,0
 The hotel does not have any food during the day before 6pm or post 1pm which is extremely inconvenient given the location of the hotel Also the day staff was very nice but the night reception could do with being a bit friendlier ,0
 All was good ,0
 Keeping the room for 2 3 hours after 12 was really expensive ,0
 Although the staff were really nice and helpful not a lot of them spoke enough english which was difficult at times ,0
 Breakfast not included ,0
 So difficult to get a seat or table in the bar area Perhaps a small area reserved for hotel guests ,0
 The beds were uncomfortable We requested a double room and got two twin beds put together with double duvet The middle of the bed was impossible to sleep on ,0
 A man that was in the entrance of the roof terrace didn t let us get in the terrace saying that it was was fully booked We went inside to find a place but we couldn t find anything so we went back to the terrace as I had seen there were many empty tables There was a nice lady who saw the card of the room and told us we are their guests so we can enter Maybe the man should ask if we stay in the hotel or not and let us enter so not ruin our experience Receptionists were really nice ,0
 Rather outdated amenities and living quarters,0
 Pool is missing in the spa that is the only thing I would change if I could ,0
 The floor of the wet room didn t direct all the water back to the show so ran out to the main bathroom ,0
 No elevator just stairs can be an issue for some,0
 Our room was like a cubby house throughout our travels we have never stayed in such a tiny room There was nowhere to move except lie on the bed nowhere along the walls to put our cases we had to put them in front of cupboards which made it difficult to use the cupboards Bathroom way too tight We understand it was the smallest room in the hotel top floor with slopping ceilings It wasn t the room size shown on the net when we booked If we had been aware of the size we would have requested to have a larger room ,0
 The room is very small ,0
 parking elevator was out of work all weekend,0
 rooms are very small,0
 At check in I was informed that booking com had charged my credit card despite I clearly asked for cash payment I do not believe it anyhow The hotel charged my card previous to my arrival on schedule I got a handicapped equipped room as this was the last they had The minibar was empty and no water in the room No value for money sorry I will look next time for another hotel ,0
 Could do with double triple glazing being as in the city was very noisy,0
 no window or fresh air in bedroom Only one lift,0
 Bar didn t stock a great selection of drinks especially gins,0
 Pina coladas need a rethink ,0
 The abruptness of one member of staff which bordered on rude but the concierge was very helpful and friendly Was not pre warned that they needed a 50 per each night we were staying deposit which would be refunded when we left as we had fully paid for the rooms 4 months earlier The bath was very slippery Only one comfortable chair in the room to sit on when there was 2 of us ,0
 No gym and breakfast was ok,0
 The restaurant closing early on a Friday night ,0
 Air conditioning was difficult to operate and room was small,0
 Bar prices ,0
 No bath in room Poor view No spa Pool area very small ,0
 Safe in the room did not work Shower although worked amazingly was inside the bath with screen built on difficult to get in and out of and I am a healthy adult so anyone older or with disabilities won t be able to use this Lighting was dull Room a little dull my husband stayed here with my son and they had a fabulous room Mine was boring dull lighting poor But adequate just expected more after knowing what some rooms are like ,0
 Quite tiny room ,0
 Quite noisy soggy bed,0
 No baked beans with the Full English breakfast They promised to fix this though ,0
 Having to pay for wi fi when you can go to a coffee shop and its free,0
 The Shower curtain in the shower was a bit short plus the spray was sideways on facing the narrower part of the shower shower when it might have been better at one end of the longer shower space and so taking a shower got the floor of the bathroom a bit drippy which I took care to dry up so as not to walk wet onto the carpetting of the room ,0
 the reception were a slow and sometimes they ignore you,0
 Everything ,0
 Breakfast is quite expensive however you have other options inside the hotel ,0
 Complicated wifi connection protocol noise from the room next door we could hear people s conversations clearly ,0
 Breakfast could be included at that price,0
 the pictures that are showen in your site are misleading the hotel does not meets the standard of a 4 stars hotel ,0
 none,0
 Breakfast dont have many choices ,0
 price sound proofing of rooms organisation price of breakfast price of parking,0
 It was a bit too warm in the hotel but we prefer that rather than too cold so no problem what so ever,0
 very dated and in desperate need of a refurb staff were not very friendly and half of them didn t understand me,0
 Pool size,0
 Could be bit cheaper,0
 Rooms are very small I couldn t open the wardrobe door past halfway which made it tricky to get stuff in or out ,0
 Would have liked a bottle of water in our room,0
 This property is Derry smal room ,0
 Sauna is steam room and to use any of the spa fitness facilities you have to book in advance While the exclusivity and privacy is nice it can be problematic if you have only limited time Room size ok but the top floor rooms have shallow areas like the bath One had to be really careful not to hit the ceiling ,0
 Single room back side small with blinded window no outside light possible no lounge for quiet internetting front desk people too cool restaurant has unpleasant ambiance hotel in full renovation ,0
 Didn t realise it was so far out of city ctre Seemed a dreary area and an ugly building,0
 the climate in the room often too could the windows not clear on the outside,0
 Small shower Small elevator,0
 It wasn t obvious what breakfast options prices were available The bed was a little too firm for a comfortable lay in The room was slightly cramped for space ,0
 misrepresentation of room star rating ok staff ,0
 Hot cooked Breakfast buffet was a little cold ,0
 Poor view from the window it was just a wall,0
 Your web site shows the location of the Hotel further along the main road and not directly behind Lancaster Tube Station We ended up walking from the bus stop opposite Lancaster Tube for a couple of miles before getting a taxi which was rather annoying ,0
 Paid Wi Fi,0
 I needed instrucitns for the air con ,0
 small rooms old hotel cold no heating in bathroom in winter equals freezing ,0
 All of it,0
 Double room was very compact even with the upgrade,0
 The rooms were very small with minimal storage space For the price we paid we expected much larger room ,0
 Two major unacceptable issues 1 The room was located pn 1st floor just opposite a huge generator which was creating extremely annoying sound Supposingly the generator was witched off after 10PM but this was not the case for the 3 nights we were there 2 Additionally the temperatur was unmanagable when we checked in the room the temperature was freezing cold We tried to open the old heater but heating did not work The 2nd day when we returned to our room the heating was working and the room temperature are most probably around 28C We tried to lowr the heating turned many times the antique sweating valves without success sleeping in such hot enviroment was total nightmare Defenetly we will never again stay in that hotel and will not recommend it to anyone ,0
 The room was very warm and maintenance tried twice but the room temperature was not able to be cooled ,0
 Noisy cramped claustrophobic rooms and misleading in all aspects Not a good neighborhood at night Reviews not correct in many aspects of location convenience and service Some rooms no windows And you can here EVERYTHING next door ,0
 There was no price list for the mini bar Some power points didn t work which made charging mobile devices a bit tricky ,0
 Not much restaurants nearby ,0
 The room was extremely hot We spoke to the management and they said it was non controllable because it is mid season We had to leave the windows open during the night ,0
 Room too small,0
 I stayed in room G02 The shower cubicle is disgusting Years of grime around the doors and down the side The shower head itself was clogged with scale and slime The bathroom sink was blocked and so back filled with water and dirt The bed is awful Two single beds put together One really lumpy and the other with a big sunken part in the middle Clearly very old and knackered The duvet was so thin it was more of a sheet I had to double it over for warmth as you can t sleep with the fan on as it s too noisy You can t also hear when the room above flushes their toilet chain It sounds like water is actually pouring into the room The tea and coffee making facility was a couple of cheap branded tea bags and a cup that was dirty and smelled of floor cleaner For 20 more I could have stayed in a Premier Inn which would have been spotless and comes with a good night guarantee ,0
 Breakfast was with low quality foood,0
 I like every thing,0
 Our room was small staff were overwhelmed with numbers on saturday night in restaurant and hotel a number of requests were forgotten eg making up a sofa bed while we were at dinner ,0
 Breakfast not included,0
 Breakfast could be better coffee is great as well ,0
 some staffs are warm but some are cool 50 50 ,0
 The bed could of been comfier considering the room package The room also needed some uplifts That was the only dissapointment,0
 Space too small,0
 A little bit pricy,0
 My room was on the other tower and was not convenient for me Need to take 2 lifts to get to my room ,0
 The room was little cold at night although the heater was on ,0
 was hoping for a balcony,0
 The doorman would not let my wife into the hotel and questioned her twice about her room number and then proceeded to shut the door in her face At breakfast we were asked which table we would like and we chose a table by the window only then to be told that we could not sit at that table because it was for 4 people the next people in was a lady and daughter who were shown to the very same table we requested we will always remember this hotel for all the wrong reasons We have a party of 12 American businessmen and women working for our company for two weeks and we will not proceed with the booking at this hotel The Dorchester for us every time from now on ,0
 The variation in prices is silly For a standard room we paid an average of 100 euro night we heard another guests bill was 80 euro and the advertised price was 409 euro Prices for breakfast room service and drinks were much too high we went elsewhere patisserie in little square at the end of the street turn left from reception is very good Standard room is quite crowded so you may prefer a larger size but small is typical for Paris Some noise issues with other guests ,0
 The rooms do not have any sound insulation You really hear everything people talking in the next room staff using vacuum cleaners doors opening and closing the noise from the street As other hotels in Spain have the same problem exzeption W Hotel in Barcelona I suppose that Spanish architects are not able to plan good sound insulations Thus I recommend German architects They are absolutely able to implement a good sound insulation In the corridor there is rubbish from the rooms nearly all the day No seperate elevators for the staff ,0
 I wanted to stay near the top of the hotel for the view however during the night between 1 5am there was always a lot of noise coming from above us like dragging tables chairs etc that s the only fault I had with the stay and would just stay a few floors lower ,0
 Had to ask for mugs in room no t towels in kitchen area ,0
 Could only pay for the restaurant food on card not in cash which was not appropriate for us ,0
 The decor will enthrall some and turn off others Though I am certain they were going for eclectic opulence it seemed odd Walls of faux snake skin faux alligator faux corrugated steel and uniformly black paint were unique but simply not my style My wife found it less of an issue i may have been additionally put off by the light switch panel with a dozen plus buttons which frustrated me as I spent several minutes just trying to light the bathroom Oh that was a seperate switch elsewhere Why I was the one tasked with adjusting the lights is another discussion One of the NASA inspired switches scared the bejesus out of me when it made a string curtain close over a wall behind me why So there would be strings over the wall I guess This isn t a bad place to kick back after enjoying Amsterdam but just not to my taste If you re there for the coffee houses it might be more to your liking I should say it was relatively affordable and if this is your bag baby go for it As another reviewer said the place is actually much darker than it appears in the photos ,0
 More information about the facilities and entertainments in the hotel will be useful I got a very good price approx 220 GBP a day so it was a good value for money Still sometimes the price is 350 which is not a great deal The operation of the TV could be a pain sometimes the response time is poor ,0
 The single room was incredibly small no space even to put a suitcase You could touch opposite walls at all times The single bed was creaky and the toilet was very hard to flush required at least two goes Very old and inefficient lift ,0
 The taps on the sink were very hard to adjust ,0
 We were planning on eating in the restaurant on our first night Mon 9th May We were very disappointed that this was not possible and were advised of a French restaurant close by The food there was excellent but very expensive Why were we not advised before we arrived that this facility would not be available It was good to be able to open French doors but garden room Stretching it a bit ,0
 It was too noisy we couldn t sleep well and there was no quiet room to change to ,0
 The rooms are outdated with very old stained carpets Bathroom facilities also need improvement ,0
 The bed was caved On both sides As if someone very heavy slept in it And the pillows were synthetic filling ,0
 It is big and busy Price value,0
 TV not working and the sink in the bathroom not working but once reported these were quickly fixed The water in the vending machine was extortionately priced for 8 a bottle Other than those minor niggles a really pleasant stay ,0
 room cold and not serviced regularly,0
 Wifi was not included ,0
 Internet coverage speed not brilliant,0
 Even if the Hotel is new it is not clean There is dust on the floor and specially in the corners Dirty badcover with someones hair which stuck inside Such basic things do not allow you to feel comfortable from the first minute in the room Warm air conditioning was not working At our stay it was around 6 outside No Heating in the bathroom no way to dry your clothing or even your towel Just one small hanger So to sum up we stayed there just one night and could live with it But were looking forward to check out We would not recommend this hotel ,0
 I booked room for 2 people the toiletries were for 1 person only Secondly I was very dissapointed as I run my marathon next day I couldnt sleep properly at night due to heat in the room There was no way to reduce the temperature for air contitioning As I opened the window was very noisy I came for 1 night only so it mattered to me a lot ,0
 the room felt slightly cold and we couldn t adjust the heating,0
 Breakfast and pillows and room too hot,0
 Room is not clein,0
 Smallish room but OK Heating on during the night in room but we should have turned it off at the wall,0
 Light fittings were quite dusty ,0
 Room was too hot,0
 Breakfast was not good very few choices If I knew I had not paid for the breakfast at this hotel and it was expensive ,0
 check in 30 mins rooms not ready at 20 00h staff overwhelmed,0
 Bathroom could do with a toilet brush,0
 420 for 2 nights is very expensive and should have at least included breakfast Also think the view of a back yard in the superior room was poor making us wonder what the standard rooms would be like ,0
 Having to pay for use of health club next door,0
 Some of the staff could have been friendlier ,0
 The website should clearly mention number of beds We asked for an extra bed and there were five beds in our room which were too many for us We were four ,0
 N a ,0
 Breakfast facilities in a restaurant outside the hotel,0
 Poor lighting rude staff worn off furniture and bathroom NOT 4 stars for sure,0
 No a bad experience as such but found the lack of access to both sides of a double bed incovenient during the night You disturb the other sleeper ,0
 Bit noisy in the early morning noise from the road becaus this hotel is located beside the Plaza Espanya Breakfast was nice but expensive considering the price ,0
 The rooms were dirty and we found blood spots in the upper bed sheets,0
 No fans to move stale air around when it got warm in the room ,0
 Bathrooms A bit cramped Plus I requested an Eiffel Tower view and willing to pay but was refused and given standard room instead Check in staff a bit rude ,0
 Expensive,0
 Not applicable,0
 it s expensive given it was a very compact room and that breakfast isn t included Unable to open window for some fresh air ,0
 One staff advised us to go to a larger supermarket when we wanted somewhere to buy cheese but she neglected to tell us how far a walk it was Looks close on map but it was at least 25min walk and it was dark She should have known better and advised us to take a cab ,0
 Air con in bedroom a bit noisy ,0
 None,0
 Disappointing not as good as the previous time I stayed here Aircon didn t work room was at front so traffic noise an issue Mattress seemed hard and I got backache afterwards ,0
 The fact that we had to leave ,0
 Rooms have not been updated since the hotel was built Staff at reception need to improve their relations with clients Some breakfast items were of poor quality ,0
 A bit noisy due bars open till late,0
 staff atitute old facilities ,0
 Thought breakfast was included but I got it wrong ,0
 The rooms are small,0
 I couldn t find any faults with this hotel ,0
 the staircase was not very clean considering that the lift is very small more attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the staircase ,0
 Amenities Price,0
 Given the location I can forgive a lot of things but a gym would have been really nice ,0
 Very very poor room e g no fridge in a four star hotel several issues with extra payments garage only 500 m from the hotel ,0
 The reception was quite frosty upon arrival and the maintenance of the room daily cleaning was not of high standard Room service menu was very limited ,0
 The Hotel has to be renovated as soon as possible No facilities for fitness ,0
 When carrying luggage do not go to Gloucester Road Tube as it is all stairs Go to Earls Court for ease of access The hotel did not inform me that there is a minimum taxi charge of 10 pounds to the tube Best to be informed ,0
 Coffee machine and automatic minibar works normally like vending machine are not working room safe was not working at my arrival because of empty battery were changed after call at reception signs on shower faucet were confounded it means if i opened the water for the hand shower the water comes from the ceiling shower Quite displesaing after getting up with the cold water ,0
 Undertrained and clueless staff Staff feel so important they forget we pay for the rooms and their wages Don t ask staff they simply don t know how to help ,0
 Breakfast,0
 Size of room elevator quite small ,0
 We had asked the reception to book a taxi 8 seater for us from the hotel to train station Sad to say we were extremely overcharged ,0
 Too noisy lifts,0
 rooms are old but OK except bathroom not very comfortable little dark shower is not comfortable hair dryer is old a coffee machine or kettle should be available in the rooms,0
 Carpets and tepich are very old and dirty,0
 A little more pricey than I wanted but worth it,0
 Being in the Hotel refurbishment industry I tend to notice more than most the Hotel for where it is in Mayfair could do with a bit of modernisation program carpets bathroom tiles ceilings in lobbies water damaged ,0
 Television needs updating ,0
 limited space for my wardrobes hanger,0
 breakfast expensive for what was on offer it costs extra to use the spa gym facility crowds of smokers right at the entrance yuk building site across the road,0
 In the evening the bar restaurant was closed for a private party I was not told of this during check in or at any other time when I asked at reception if another room had been made available i e The business lounge I was told that if I required any food or drink I would have to use room service On a Saturday evening this is not acceptable and the attitude of the staff on reciption was very take it or leave it attitude Also the hotel is looking very tired and need of refurbishment I will never stay at this hotel again I have been using it for many years and now I will be looking for other places to stay ,0
 We had booked a twin room We got a twin room but it had one huge duvet I would have liked to have separate duvets ,0
 Check in a little awkward I was early and had to wait in the bar no problem however guests arriving after me were given room keys Had to ask manager who explained some rooms weren t ready but I could look at one that was which we ended up staying in as it was perfect maybe the receptionist moody harried by ringing phone could have offered this level of service Other than that MINOR detail this hotel is exceptional and the location perfect ,0
 Price could be somewhat lower especially as there is no breakfast or food available ,0
 Not good view from windows little kitchen ,0
 The heat and the noise outside the hotel was all night for some reason,0
 Everything was spot on for me ,0
 Fairly laid back,0
 WE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING A BALCONY WITH SITTING AREA BUT WE WERE GIVEN A ROOM WITH A SMALLER BALCONY WITHOUT SEATING BUT NOT REALLY A PROBLEM AS OUR ROOM WAS VERY NICE ,0
 No bad experiences ,0
 I enjoyed all my visit ,0
 There were a lot of stairs ,0
 I appreciate that London rooms are small but this place takes it to the extreme The sole lift in the place fits no more than 3 people and is extremely slow Ridiculous that if you want a cappuccino during your complimentary breakfast that you need to pay extra ,0
 Early morning i could hear the faint rambling of the underground Metro train which is near by The small indoor pool was rather cold ,0
 The AC was not working while we were there which led to restless sleep The complimentary breakfast was good but it did not have a big selection ,0
 A small problem in that the electrical socket on one side of the bed was not working would have been good to be able to charge my phone overnight as I use it as my alarm ,0
 I didn t like that the water closet lid covers the flash button ,0
 no granola at breakfast no access to BBC on TV,0
 The rooms are in desperate need of a refresh The beds are horrible The bathroom is more updated and functional You have to hunt for a plug and the carpets need to be replaced ,0
 No complimentary tea or coffee,0
 Staffs are not helpful Out of my 3 nights stay and probably 7 8 different Staffs I have encountered day and night There are only 1 lady at front desk and 2 gentlemen helping me with luggages are nice The rest is either cold or not helpful at all ,0
 wifi very slow,0
 The bed isn t comfortable at all and the bathroom is very tiny I can barely fit in it There was a lady in the restaurant her name is Alexandra she was rude and obnoxious,0
 Only downside rooms a bit compact but not really an issue for me maybe for others,0
 The times allocated to children being able to swim in the very small pool My son is 11 and a fantastic swimmer we were so disappointed that he couldn t use the pool more even though the girl who checked us in said he could they were pretty flexible but this was not the case ,0
 Only demerit was the tiny little bars of soap,0
 The rooms are not very well soundproofed ,0
 Rooms were very small,0
 No lift and narrow staircase room is so small Reception and staying in different building,0
 They blocked some money on my card and they haven t unblock them yet ,0
 Needs a larger check in area to handle numbers of people ,0
 everything,0
 Expensive old furniture small room stuff on reception not care about you stay or request,0
 If you travel with kids it s only possible to book the biggest room no matter what is in the reservation confirmation ,0
 Booked club lounge access for a renaissance it was lacking the usual selection of drinks and food items The eggs at breakfast could have done with being hotter A better equipped serving area would probably help Also no slippers or robes in room ,0
 The maze like corridors The smaller rooms could do with leaner or less furniture Breakfast could do with a change in menu every 3 days at least For longer stays gets repetitive even if somewhat extensive ,0
 Moldy smell in the bathroom Uncomfortable and awkward bed ,0
 Charge for pool Cost of breakfast,0
 Booked the small double so it was a bit small but only there for a one night stay ,0
 Sadly the maintenance of this hotel seems to be sadly lacking We were put into a room and the air conditioning wasn t working It appeared that the Gaul was on the whole floor talking to other people We were moved to another room after complaining There was a fault with the hot water in the hotel Tepid shower Friday night stone cold Saturday morning its bad when you have to boil a kettle to have a wash Hot water restored Saturday night but off again Sunday We had had 4 drinks in the bar on the Saturday and they offered us 20 off the bill which barely covered the service charge which we found quite pathetic Eventually the whole bar bill was written off but I would have preferred to pay the bill and have had hot water ,0
 The bed is too small for two,0
 WiFi is paid unusual and an unexpected surprise in a hotel these days The hotel caters to some large groups which can make check in check out challenging depending on timing There is no restaurant in the hotel though it is very close to the Mariahilfer Strasse which has a wide choice of restaurants ,0
 The heather did not work the tv didn t work and the bath bubbles did nt work and therefore I would expect something in return ,0
 Do not expect abt coffee I was supposed to pay in cash so i exchanged money for it but they just got paid with my credit card without asking or even mentioning it at all The hotel and the cathedral church right next to the hotel are under construction So one of our window was useless ,0
 A little room mishap but was sorted swiftly ,0
 Room was dusty dirty the shower head was broken so couldn t shower properly The room was so noisy all night Didn t get asked how our stay was when we checked out ,0
 Very expensive minibar ,0
 Queue for breakfast this is not a big problem and it is generally not a long wait The staff is attentive and provides refreshments while you wait Note that the queue exists only if you decide to have your breakfast late For early works up to 9 00 or 9 30 there was not queue ,0
 Room was small,0
 We arrived early and were told to come back at 3 PM When we returned the room was still not ready We waited in the bar with complimentary drinks until the room was ready ,0
 very thin walls and heavy noisy doors,0
 The food at the breakfast buffet is varied and abundant but not everything is very good the eggs are dry the granola is rancid and the grapefruit bitter And the worst the plates and the serving utensils were burning hot from being under the bright spotlights but every day someone gave me a fresh one which hadn t been heated after I complained The hair dryer in the room was encased in a drawer and had a cord which didn t allow me to reach any mirror but they gave me another one ,0
 There could have been some shelving in the bathroom for washbags etc and more places to hang towels ,0
 We have asked the room to be made several times but cleaning wasnt done properly any of the days Only bathroom seemed to have been done properly ,0
 Security My friend was stolen her bag becuase of very poor security at the restaurant Nobody checks people who come into the restaurant so thieves can easily get into the restaurant and wait for target ,0
 Very small bedroom with shockingly too small wardrobe,0
 Door handle fell off in my room Was fixed quickly though ,0
 In warmer months it is difficult to sleep without air conditioning ,0
 My only complaint would be glass door on the bathroom and no fan in the shower which makes it for smelly bath But not a deal breaker by any means ,0
 rooms a bit tired no bedside tables ,0
 The room was tiny maybe 3m X 3m at most Barely enough room for us to walk around ,0
 Minor building work next to hotel was a bit dusty but no noise issues ,0
 No milk in the room and difficult to obtain from room service Too few lifts when full,0
 The location is not idle to say the least ,0
 the rooms are not clean enough especially the carpets and bathroom tiles We got a retractable bed for an adult wifi is not that good ,0
 1 Location It is indeed VERY far from the city center Tram can get very crowded not a pleasure with suitcases etc Taxi to Central station is 20 but at least a more comfortable ride 2 Price is a bit steep considering the location so far away from everything ,0
 It wasn t very clean or air con only had a little fan to keep us cool in the heat And was very expensive for what you got ,0
 Currently undergoing building work so view of building site next door not great,0
 The check in took ages when we got to the desk it took 20 minutes We were short of time because of this and then when we got to the room there was someone else s luggage in it which then delayed us getting ready to go out to a show as we had to wait for the owner to collect it apparently the hotel staff had misplaced it ,0
 Pillows could be more comfortable and housekeeping could do better in terms of cleaning bed making and replenishing toilet rolls ,0
 The only negative was that there was no baby changing facility in our wing so once we checked out the was no where to change my baby However staff allowed us to access our old room again to resolve this so no complaints there ,0
 the room shower was bad because I almost break my leg as I came out of the shower for a towel there was water all the floor from the shower ,0
 The staff behind reception were rude,0
 Breakfast could have been better For the standard of the hotel I would have expected a higher quality of the cooked options Maybe more to order ,0
 Did not like the breakfast that we had pre paid for at the hotel so went to caf across road good breakfast at half the price The Hotel is good but lacks a bar area there is plenty of room to accommodate one seems a shame,0
 A bit too little to choose from at the breakfast,0
 Staff,0
 It did take some time to check in as they could only process one customer at a time so on the way in and out we had to wait 5 10 mins each time Not a major issue though ,0
 Water pressure to light,0
 Everything in the hotel you have to pay for it like coffee breakfast even for bags weighting and there is no minibar in the room,0
 usual parisian small room ,0
 Spa massages weren t the full 55 minutes as expected however when I bought this up with the manager she was really helpful and deducted the price and also gave me her email to contact her directly in the future ,0
 the room we stayed in was too small the swimming pool was not the same shown in the advert It looks smaller,0
 There were no drawers for clothes There was a nice closet and a drawer in each night stand but no dresser ,0
 There wasn t much natural light due to the surrounding buildings ,0
 Shower screen over bath leaked across the floor ,0
 Accessaroues at toilets,0
 i didnt like that the room wasnt quite fair compared to the pictures in booking especially bathroom eventhough really comfortable room ,0
 No clear distinction of the hotel on the street If you re not familiar with the streets buildings of London you could easily walk past the hotel and not take notice of it Walls floors and room doors are not sound proof I would ve much rather been disturbed by the noise in the streets than from guest neighbors and hotel staff Easily hear housekeeping and other staff talking walking Frustrating For a five star hotel one would expect sound proof doors at least Though the hotel is relatively new the eclectic themed rooms are way outdated most of the room features such as lighting A C and curtains are controlled electronically and sometimes they didn t work properly ,0
 It was very hot and the airconditioning didn t work,0
 No coffee in the room,0
 Breakfast,0
 The hotel has seen better days The d cor generally was tired Various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use The room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on The staff were generally uninterested On early arrival I asked if I could have access to the room to get changed as I had cut my leg while travelling I wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it Two of the three staff members I asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury The third staff member offered me a Band Aid and use of the ladies toilets Its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle Five minutes in the room or any room and I would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue I particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room He implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while I m standing at reception bleeding I wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened I further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay They didn T Instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake I remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened Breakfast was average Service remained indifferent Not what I expect from a four star hotel I wouldn t recommend or return to it ,0
 noise from station heard from bedroom,0
 If you are travelling alone the single rooms will fall short of your expectation The rooms are very small and claustrophobic Beds are pushed up against windows with terrible drafts I had to use my clothes to seal window and a suitcase to protect myself from draft Very uncomfortable When asked to change to another room the same situation ,0
 Room was a little small but to be expected in the location ,0
 Required an extra pillow which I never got also lost English channels so reported this never got this sorted went two days with lost channels,0
 price of breakfast 14 on top of B B not in with offer,0
 For the price they charge the room didn t include basic facilities like tea and coffee bags that most travellers would expect One of the taps in the bathroom was leaking At one occasion the room cleaning staff tried to open the room for cleaning the room without even knocking to ensure there was no one inside and that too at 9am ,0
 No tea or coffee making facilities in the room,0
 Our room was double booked the taxi arrangements were chaotic overpriced,0
 sometimes there could be more people at reception to avoid waiting time,0
 Would have loved a swimming pool,0
 Room service was not easy to have Also there was no refrigerator in the room which was a big turn off The bar downstairs was always a little difficult to get staff to support ,0
 The only thing that it needed was a drink making facilities in the room After a night on the town enjoying yourself all you need is a refresher when you wake up but we had to get showered get changed and then make our way 5 floors to get a drink Wouldn t use the hotel for more than 2 nights it would start to get irritable for the lack of space in the rooms ,0
 I asked 2 connected room with extra bed they gave me 2 room in different floor and no extra bed available I asked more blanket and below they told me they have only 2 blanket It was bad experience,0
 Room walls a bit thin could hear people from next room speaking loudly at 2 am in the morning I suppose depends on the people you get in the next room Also hotel breakfast a bit expensive at 13 ,0
 small rooms no view expensive ,0
 The holder of the shower head could be better the excellent water pressure means the holder can go into an uncontrollable spin if you lose concentration for a second ,0
 Hot water was not very hot although staff on the reception on out check out said that it can be fixed ,0
 narrow washbasin room rate is on the expensive side,0
 For some reason housekeeping did not restock towels everyday,0
 There was one staff member looking after check in out as well as operating as the concierge While they were very helpful when there s a line of people waiting there s pressure to be hasty with questions bookings etc ,0
 Clearer explanation of how the car parking operates but it worked out alright in the end ,0
 The prearrangements we tried to make for the restaurant and SKYY bar ended up a mess The breakfast food other than the croissants was awful Horrible scrambled eggs everything that should be hot was cold the sliced fruit was all dried up the baked beans had a skin on them Nobody appeared to be in charge of the food on offer The room was too hot and the temperature could not be controlled ,0
 would have preferred tea and coffee making facilities and an iron although the hotel does laundry at a cost My partner would have preferred a bigger gym but these are all personal,0
 Not include breakfast,0
 Breakfast in with the price,0
 We should have been informed that this property has no alcohol license BEFORE confirming booking We found out when we went to restaurant for dinner We didn t eat there and there wasn t a huge amount of options in the vicinity This almost spoiled our break I would never consider going back because of this Please consider informing people in future ,0
 Brasserie Restaurant menu was ok but could be a litle more interedting,0
 Staff was rude The room was very cold we almost freezed ,0
 Restaurant floor was dirty,0
 Staff doesn t speak english well Long check out,0
 It is an expensive place To pay 5 GBP for a beer at the Hotel lobby is not cheap is it ,0
 Parking was not convenient ,0
 Lift out of action and we were on 4th floor but couldnt be helped check in was an hour and a half late due to late check outs by customers and had to ask for a free drink for the inconvenience but apologies were offered by staff,0
 Standard of the room,0
 The place looks old the curtains in the room were supposed to be white but they were black from all the dust ,0
 I liked it all No issues ,0
 Perhaps little room in the breakfast area and bit difficult to find the way to the pool from our room ,0
 Overpriced Small Room AC Did not seem to work No warm water in shower ,0
 The smell of sweaty socks on the first floor corridor ,0
 Interconnecting rooms are more noisy didn t request one as sounds carry more Cleaners left nearby door on latch whilst cleaning at 7am and it was continually banging When we asked them to close they did so and apologised but it happened again 2 mornings later We were on holiday and wanted a lie in ,0
 I have bought a early checkin and when we arrived our room was not ready We have to wait almost 30 minutes do go to the room In the same day we try to eat something in the bar At 10 10pm I ordered a sandwich and until almost 11 pm it had not yet arrived I canceled my order after knowing that the sandwich machine was in trouble Why did not they tell me that when I ordered the food The hotel don t have a well trained staff Unfortunately Sofitel is out of my list of the best hotels ,0
 Lifts breaking down regularly The soundproof room is not soundproof You could hear the snoring of the next door neighbour and his mobile phone conversations in the middle of the night ,0
 No parking nor vallet Breakfast could be improved,0
 Late night call from Housekeeping asking if the room needed cleaning at 9 50pm ,0
 The restaurant is in a remote location however it is a short walk approx 10 minutes to the closest metro station The staff were not very helpful however there is a computer in the reception to help you get around Milan Be aware of the air conditioning there are only two settings on and off and the hotel decides whether it is hot or cold so you may need to use the natural air outside to cool down as the hotel is very hot ,0
 Tempeture was too hot and controls didnt work,0
 The radiator in the room was a bit noisy but the staff were so kind and helpful even reserving another room for us they even refunded us some of our money because of this,0
 Rate is a bit to the high side ,0
 We did have to call multiple times to get out 50 Euro holding deposit down which wasn t acceptable The hotel admitted fault but it s still not good enough ,0
 The hotel room was not very clean,0
 I did not particularly like the strong room perfume that floated around the entire facility ,0
 Not very well isolated I could hear my neighbours talk in their room next door ,0
 Didn t like the breakfast much and I thought it rather expensive,0
 n a,0
 Kept catching my leg on the corner of the bed which is quite sharp gone home with a couple of bruises Disappointed that there wasn t a bath but every thing else was excellent Also would have liked another mirror in the bedroom when doing my hair ,0
 The receptionist chinese looking with black hair was very negative and rude she was acting like she is not in the mood for anyone Never saw her smile for 4 nights of stay So many roles Like water boiler and irons are not allowed in the room and if they were found by the staff it will be taken away till the end of the stay Breakfast is very limited,0
 I liked everything about the hotel ,0
 The hotel i integrated in a multi purpose building and apart from the rooms and breakfast area it doesn t offer other facilities ,0
 The stairs,0
 fitness facilities are limited the pool is very small so off season OK but during hot days may get too crowded The rooms and especially the bathroom is made of not so solid materials giving a little bit of a cheaper feeling,0
 Lack of parking and the room didn t have a view ,0
 No free Wi Fi which is really ridiculous for the room price ,0
 Far from the central London ,0
 could have been better signposted,0
 On entering the room the immediate reaction was of ingrained dust It really smelled like the carpets and curtains needed replacing Bathroom was clean Air conditioning didn t work and I constantly had to ask for it to be looked at I woke up on the first two nights out of three very hot and stuffy The bed and pillows were incredibly hard and uncomfortable ,0
 To get to the bedrooms you have to pass the staff entrance to the kitchen Based on the language being used and at high volume Gordon Ramsey was working that night In the bedroom all was good Unfortunately in the bathroom water would not drain from the handbasin due to a build up of hair and gunk in the plug hole had to clean it and the rain shower head in the ceiling shower was almost completely block with calc build up had to clean it Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel with matching prices ,0
 Ceramic mugs would have been better than paper cups in the bedroom,0
 Room too small needed maintenance,0
 Carpet in the hallways very dated ,0
 The hotel was undergoing renovation Had I known this in advance I would not have chosen to stay at this hotel It would seem only fair to notify people beforehand Also as a four star rated hotel the facilities and overall appearance of the room does not come up to par with this rating ,0
 The roof top bar was very expensive at 30 euro for a gin and a whiskey,0
 Although the room looked modern the electrics left a lot to be desired First of all two of the bulbs in the lights were not working On top of that the hairdryer blew up when my partner was drying her hair Although the staff did their best to help with the situation it left a little bit of a bad feeling about the stay,0
 A bit of a pain to get to on foot ,0
 Room was a little small but that was the only bad thing ,0
 more secure,0
 It has a certain smell Couldn t work out what it was but was quite manly and heavy in the corridors ,0
 Very small toilet in the room Breakfast hardly contains any vegstables,0
 Getting out of the underground car park up steep ramp with bike rack on back was a bit hair raising,0
 The pillow was not comfortable almost flat too low and hard ,0
 the lift stopped at the 2nd floor and steep stairs to the 3rd 4th floors,0
 The bathrooms should have heating arrangements ,0
 Hot breakfast served on a cold plate ,0
 Lack of swimming pool La rambla is seedy drugs offered on every corner and ladies of the night quite aggressive Not hotels fault,0
 the fact that the room was much smaller than the website photos pretended,0
 We booked a junior suite and when reached found it too small so paid an extra 500GBP to upgrade to St James Suite ,0
 The beds are hard but more strange the matrasses do not stay in place they slide off to the side ,0
 I thought Bar area could be better ,0
 Check in staff tried to up sell us a couple of times,0
 room was a little dated but very clean ,0
 What is there not to like ,0
 Thermostat needs turned up ran a bath after a long day in London and it was dissapointing requested a southern view but didn t receive even after check in staff told me I did have breakfast was lukewarm so once it hit the plates it became cold quickly was asked for 60 deposit for mini bar and when checking out they managed to charge me again instead of refunding very dissapointing for my first hilton visit ,0
 Would have loved to rate this beautiful establishment higher but the staff wasn t very friendly or helpful We were only allowed to checkin at 5 30 Not a pleasant experience after a very long flight We had to hang around feeling tired and needed a shower desperately Absolutely the worse you could do to your guests ,0
 Breakfast just ok,0
 Every room seems to have their own problems for example two out of three rooms I stayed suffers from a loose socket cover The other room has the blinds falling off from the wall Breakfast is very limited i e almost all items are cold food apart from boiled eggs ,0
 Everything,0
 Standard and facilities are poor,0
 The air con wasn t working which made the room very stuffy No face towels shampoo or conditioners were given and we were only given flimsy paper cups ,0
 Some of the decor could do with a lick of paint,0
 I thought that the deluxe room was a little small,0
 Check in welcome,0
 Every things is ok except the A C it is only warm ,0
 Step up then down into the bathroom I fell and hurt myself on our first night I thought I was going to go through the glass Luckily I didn t break anything ,0
 The towels were terrible very dirty and smelly ,0
 There was a mix up when it came to checking us in to our room so the process took over an hour It was eventually dealt with but at no point were we offered much of an apology or a drink at the bar while they sorted out the mess which was disappointing The shower door in our room didn t close properly wither but it didn t affect the quality of the stay overall ,0
 Quite small double bed for 2 persons,0
 The construction work in the street they closed the main street entrance so the taxi or the car cannot drop you off in the main entrance,0
 little or no food available from the bar the hotel is not in a good area lots of derelict buildings around no good restaurants in walking distance or even close driving distance Would not feel safe at night walking back to the hotel ,0
 No proper bar area ,0
 There were 4 elevators in the hotel but still you had to wait a very long time And many times the elevator was too crowded so you had to wait for the next one It would also work better if the hotel would have a separate elevator to the skylounge for non hotel guests ,0
 Scrambled egg was v poor for an 18 breakfast ,0
 Didn t like the outlook from the room ,0
 Breakfast is overpriced No replenishment of bathroom amenities ,0
 Read the positive this is mostly event related The room we were given was very small tiny for 2 It was the only available one as Milan was hosting the Expo 2015 We chose to stay again 4 days later from our road trip to the south and we were given a larger room very adequate No Parking however PAID at least but expensive ,0
 Cocktails a little expensive compared to local bars ,0
 The hotel is in need of redecoration Carpets in corridors are wron Waste bin in hotel room was un emptied,0
 Breakfast could have been better,0
 The beds were not very comfortable Hard mattessss,0
 The bathroom is a glass frosted cubicle in the room a little more privacy would be nice The breakfast is overpriced but then again this is the same in most hotels ,0
 Fo9r 152 a night disappointed not to be able to make a coffee in the morning had to pay for one by calling room service Mini bar was incredibly expensive ,0
 Very hot in the room,0
 very small rooms some rooms have no windows and some have windows but NO VIEW there is a wall blocking any possible view ,0
 Some renovation and reconstruction work is going on in the Hotel while we are staying which disturbing us so much ,0
 Room was very cold when entering and staff provided with an additional heater as the some panel of the double glazing had been removed Lack of power points Construction on Bond Street made the evening very noisy Carpets looks very old and stained ,0
 The weather was cold,0
 Relaxing and food and the bar area,0
 Soundproof is rather poor We could hear the people talking on the street with the window closed as well as the trains passing by underground ,0
 Smelly drain smell in the bathroom although we could shut the door ,0
 Just a small chair extra in the room would be great nicer to sit together that way ,0
 Paying for wifi ,0
 all ok ,0
 The hotel is a construction site noisy constant drilling and the management don t care Simply put don t stay here ,0
 Would recommend the hotel to add gym to its facilities The area around the hotel looks as industrial district though the hotel has security inside and looks safe ,0
 airconditioning really poor in my room receptionist dint bother to fix,0
 Uncomfortable bed very hard Noise from corridor leaked into room due to gap in the door jam ,0
 Entire hotel needs a facelift very dated Service was not consistent Guests had to pay to use gym facilities Not sure why this has 4 stars ,0
 Location,0
 I didnt like a lot First of all staff was absolutely terrible No smile at all when i have asked a guy at the reception for anything they were rude and didnt help us at all Room was very very small Bed was so noisy that I couldn t even move to not disturb others I mean other rooms And no we didn t have fun there Never again ,0
 Bath towels too small No mini bar facility only two bottles of water and no nibbles or snacks Only UHT milk supplied with tea coffee and no biscuits Double room but only one glass provided Lack of toiletries Enjoyed the breakfast but would have appreciated more choice ie eggs scrambled poached etc For a 5 star hotel would expect a few extras ,0
 Rooms are small,0
 A lot of noise The door was creaking all the time Small room and breakfast does not have many options ,0
 Small rooms but it s not an issue because come for enjoying seeing the city,0
 The hotel itself was a little noisy think we were located below a generator,0
 30 euro per day extra charge for the parking garage,0
 The rooms were awfully designed extremely clostrophopic dark and simply ugly The wifi is crazy slow,0
 Breakfast was average and the staff seemed a bit grumpy and not particularly helpful,0
 they took 5 euros to bring up a bucket of ice usuly i tip 3 10 euro but to take it as a mandatory,0
 Couldn t get a sandwich after 11 except room service,0
 room a bit stuffy but aircon was available,0
 Full English breakfast could have been included rather than just the continental We had to upgrade when we arrived ,0
 We had to leave,0
 Lack of consistency with cleaners Suited didn t have doors between roooms bit more basic hotel than I expected for the price Restaurant didn t offer child s breakfast expected you to pay adult price for the tiny amount they eat ,0
 the furniture of the room is a little sad it is not useful not to have the the wardrobe in the room,0
 Cleaner swimming area and changing rooms ,0
 No complaints,0
 not very clean bed uncomfortable very noisy but that can t really be helped with noise from outside ,0
 Wifi free,0
 My request for late checkout was not well handled,0
 Noisy kids in pool meant I didn t go in but it was Easter so to be expected I guess ,0
 tiny hotel tiny elevator photos available on the internet exaggerate,0
 Very low standards Old and faded for me personally was looking like a hostel Breakfast very poor and the food was the same every day Really disappointed with the standards for the price I paid Never back there again ,0
 Level of staffing in bar could have been better Waiter was trying very hard to attend to everyone ,0
 some reception were not friendly and unhelpful ,0
 Room was quite stuffy and aircon didn t work A mini bar fridge in the room would be good to keep drinks cold ,0
 Having to speak to concierge for them to then pass you onto the Reception Cleaning Staff very noisy in the morning We were room 604 cleaning cupboard right next to it Cracked tap in the bathroom Scales in the bathroom Not the cleanest,0
 Garden next to road so a little noisy ,0
 Lifts difficult to locate on upper floors,0
 We stayed in room 406 We had the following issues Very hot room with faulty aircon Hard beds Bathroom cold and not sparkling clean Shower doors didn t meet at the top and there was some mold on the grouting ,0
 There isn t really anything to dislike about this hotel however the breakfast selection could have a wider variety of choices ,0
 The carpets was clean but think it could do with a change as lots of marks stains ,0
 Free water was not easy to notice ,0
 I have stayed in other mercures and the breakfast wasn t as varied The make your own coffee machine was in an awkward position and there was always a queue In previous hotels the staff bring you coffee pots to your table and this machine meant we didn t get to enjoy our meal together as one of us was in a queue for a good portion of the meal for a hot drink They need to refill food a little quicker as the fruit salad was mainly grapes and a little disappointing ,0
 The fire alarms are very sensitive Probably they should change the carpets in the rooms ,0
 I could not fault anything about this excellent hotel ,0
 I would have preferred a room with a view ,0
 Felt somewhat cramped ,0
 No A C,0
 I don t recall any issues at all ,0
 Although not great inconvenience there is no public bar in winter months December for our stay and only the roof top terrace bar open in summer Rooms at front are on busy main road and noisey ,0
 General d cor carpets in the room corridor areas have seen better days and made the place look a little tired ,0
 Late check in,0
 Everything was good ,0
 Aggressiveness of European staff,0
 Minor point but coffee at breakfast time was terrible That s about the only fault I could find with the place so overall very very good ,0
 TV didn t work,0
 Some noise from room on floor above,0
 No tea coffee making facilities in the room fair walk from public transport so taxi necessary most of the time,0
 May be early check in would have been better but overall everything was perfect,0
 So called library could use a bigger selection with a few more English language books,0
 The configuration of the hotel was complicated and we seemed to walk along way up and down stairs with our bag Needs better explanation Breakfast is expensive ,0
 Long walk from elevators to reach room Little waiting time at elevators three out of four were operational ,0
 A little bit to many yourng people partiing at the hotel ,0
 Room furniture is very old Cleanliness not very good There was no good WiFi coverage in my room High rate per a night for such an old hotel and not very clean hotel ,0
 facility is old service is very very slow you can wait 30mins at reception ,0
 Breakfast was a little expensive at 14 for a buffet,0
 Parking Is Not Easy,0
 The bed was too hard ,0
 Busy street traffic in front of your room ,0
 I did not like being at the front of the hotel We stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front Nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street,0
 The staff were a little miserable Maybe they didn t like working at Easter ,0
 Room was quite small but we didn t spend much time there Breakfast is overpriced ,0
 The breakfast was all the time too crowdy for the little space people need to wait others leave the table to find a place to have your breakfast ,0
 Old hotel rude staff old room bad house keeping,0
 We lived in the ground floor I donot like it,0
 The rooms are so small that you can barely move inside The ventilation in the bathroom was not working well so it was always stinking because of humidity ,0
 little room,0
 Bar area on ground floor,0
 High price ,0
 Pool was really small breakfast not so good and definitely not worth 30 per person ,0
 the short stay,0
 Thrown out of bar with locals hotel bar doesn t have as good a selection of drinks A bit sparse not such a homely feeling Sausages a little anemic and under cooked Very expensive experience No alcohol in the mini bar ,0
 We were not told the hotel was undergoing renervations when we booked also I paid for an upgrade because I was led to believe I would get a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower but was disappointed when we were on the other side ,0
 Nil,0
 Breakfast is extremely poor no atmosphere in the hotel at all ,0
 The step to enter the shower,0
 Our window looked into what felt like a lift shaft no view at all Waited 1 2 hour for breakfast by a very snooty head waiter Who made us feel we weren t good enough to be there ,0
 Curtains were dusty bed and bath linen very poor quality bed was uncomfortable and gave me back ache Tea and coffee was a bit lack lustre How do you expect a person to make a decent cup of tea with small uh t milk Only one large bath towel provided for two people does this mean only one person can shower Walls were very thin I could hear the gentlemen next door snoring,0
 Our room was located next to store room and stairs meaning it was quiet noisy Also windows are not sealed so the room was pretty cold was not too bad due to warm blankets though and wind was blowing through it eg would not recommend with small children ,0
 Although bed was a king the room and bathroom was very small,0
 The breakfast was very good but compared to many other top 4 star hotels the selection for the breakfast buffet was limited We were staying in room 106 there was noise of air con motor which did disturb our sleep a little ,0
 the chicken curry was undercooked but they brought a fresh one,0
 There was not breakfast,0
 Not enough tea bags and some of the decor in the corridors could do with updating ,0
 The room was a little dark but for London it was really large ,0
 Rooms small,0
 Limited selection of beverages from the pool bar ,0
 VERY small bedroom more like a boat cabin Not exactly stylish furnishing Shower in the bathroom was broken ,0
 Very pricey for breakfast,0
 The hotel was lovely and the staff were great there were only two issues One I feel is partially booking com s failure but at no point we were told of the tourist tax so had a surprise extra 30 pound on the hotel price Further to that the wifi of the hotel did not work sufficiently which meant we could not use our smart tv ,0
 No slippers provided available even when we asked front desk Odd for a 4 star hotel Also no bathrobe provided either Also no toiletries provided apart from a 2 in 1 shower gel shampoo But there was a notice saying to ask front desk for it Front desk staff weren t rude but not exactly friendly either for hospitality business No welcome farewell greeting Pleasant though if you asked them something directly ,0
 No decaf tea ,0
 lack of facilities in the property swimming pool sauna wellness considering the price you pay the hotel was no smoking but yet you could smell smoke through out the corridor I was on Now I personally don t have an issue with this but I think if your are going to put warnings in every room in regards to smoking and drug use you should police this a lot more vigilantly The main thing for our group was the lack of in hotel facilities for a 4 star property it is something that should be looked at for future development ,0
 a refridgerator in the room would have been nice to keep drinks cold,0
 Tired old and dark decor Lobby was filled with gaudy bronze statues and tired carpet Given the area the hotel is located Canary Wharf it doesn t echo its surroundings When the modern Novotel opens across the road they will need to modernise the rooms here quickly Additionally I left my luggage with concierge after I checked out and upon returning they had been mixed up with other guests Luckily everything was located in the end however this suggests a lack of organisation and commitment to great service Finally before we left the hotel there was an incident in the lobby area where water poured through the ceiling alongside light fittings Other guests notified the staff of this however the staff were not at all concerned or fazed by the imminent safety risks posed by water and electricity mixing The area was half heartedly cordoned off buckets placed to catch the water in the wrong spots and then everyone went back to work No sense of urgency or surprise regarding this Maintainence issue ,0
 Very basic very noisy draft at window end so hot feet cold head lack of plugs Had to lift a kettle of boiling water off the floor from under the desk You get what you pay for this was expensive for what it was No tv very loud music in the bar,0
 If in your neighborough room reserved by a low culture people you will hear them ,0
 slow wi fi the room was a little bit small and dark,0
 The breakfast buffet was not worth the price the warm buffet was half empty so we went out for breakfast on the second day ,0
 For Knightsbridge hotel and for a Millenium hotel I ve stayed in millenniums in New York and other places around the UK it was a little outdated in the room The chairs desk bathroom the hallway decor and the carpets throughout ,0
 The only fault was possibly the breakfast could have been slightly better some of the time when we arrived some of the options had run out and one day we had to use the overflow room on the first floor ,0
 wifi could be more performing,0
 Weak hairdryer ,0
 No issues,0
 The wifi didn t work,0
 The duvet on the single bed in twin room didn t cover my feet It was too small and I m only 5 6 Two men came to the door and said they needed to check the mattresses For two girls who were staying this was quite intimidating especially because the reception staff had not called to let us know that checks were being carried out ,0
 Poor breakfast compare to the price Small tab and no walk in shower No sport channels on TV,0
 Staff were too busy chatting away rather than paying attention to their front counter some seemed rather rude,0
 The internet is too slow and need improvement,0
 Next time I would pay the very few extra pounds for a larger bed I selected the twin and forgot how much I like to stretch out while I sleep ,0
 Better lounge for the more elderly ,0
 The beds are dated and not very comfortable,0
 Noisy in the evenings noisy in the mornings Not ideal for either an early night or a lie in Breakfast was limited unless you wanted to pay extra for the cooked options ,0
 The bathrooms smelt like cabbage and the halls are very narrow so you can hear quite a lot ,0
 The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done ,0
 Room could be refurbed looking tired ,0
 air conditioning did not cool the room at all ,0
 Bathroom was little small,0
 The window of our room was directly above a noisy hotel generator which kept us awake all night When we complained about this we were offered a pathetic 50 as a goodwill gesture instead of proper discount that more properly reflected the discomfort we had experienced ,0
 The beds were not as comfy as I had hoped but still a lovely stay ,0
 I thought the food was a bit pricey ,0
 Very small room,0
 Basement room seemed odd as was exec double carpet was stained room was a bit old window area was cold there wasnt a view ,0
 Lack of modern double glazed windows for sound proofing and draught free Paint work needs a touch up ,0
 When we got there we had no towels at all When they cleaned the room the second day they only gave us one towel Small gripe in otherwise great stay ,0
 Room temperature is up to 20 maximum in the Jan we called Front Desk to adjust and been told to give time to warm up but it didn t work room is cold ,0
 The hotel is very far from city center I would only stay here if I will transit in Amsterdam ,0
 This hotel has some problem with the ventillation no individual exhaust from bathrooms as if the ducts were narrow So the first impression is not good Afterwards when the AC is operating it is not that bad A good roof ventillator why not with a solar panel should solve the problem ,0
 Beds are a bit small of anyone in excess of 6 feet tall Staff made you feel a bit miserable,0
 Room too small and the sink in the room is a little odd to me,0
 Rooms are way too hip Meaning they are not It feels like someone overtried to be cool I had a room facing inner building that had no view and was dark The room just feels cold and un authentic Normally i enjoy spending time in my room This time I didnt I ve been in much better rooms Shower is ok ,0
 The fact that there is no separate bathroom The bathroom facilities are split between a shower to one side a toilet in another room and a sink in the middle of the room Didn t bother me much but can be inconvenient and not very private although you can section off the whole area of the room with sliding doors ,0
 Area around hotel is being developed so will be better once that is finished ,0
 The neiberhoud is too quit for a vocation but is 5 min walk from underground train ,0
 1 towel for me and the kid wich is not too confortable,0
 The travel cot offered to my 12 month old baby only had the thin hard base mattress it comes with Very very disappointing as expected a good quality mattress and asked for one in my booking request which was obviously ignored If the hotel had read it they should have got in touch with me to inform me that they did could not supply a decent travel cot mattress It is unforgivable that I had no choice but to let my baby sleep on this horrible base especially since we were in London for 1 night for HIS birthday AND he had not been well and had fever since the day before our arrival He tossed and turned all night not because he was unwell he is a good sleeper and actually sleeps better when he has fever and I should know as he has suffered from fever lots of times but because he is used to a luxury mattress at home Also baby food could not be warmed up in the restaurant so had to offer my baby his lunch at room temperature for the first time in his life which was too cold for him and he refused it This upset me enormously ,0
 Disappointed the Roof Bar Spa not open informed both due to launch the following week Bad smell of drainage in entrance foyer but probably just due to the ongoing building work Very modern fab colours but lacking warmth a bit sterile and clinical in atmosphere Perhaps more fresh flowers around and offers in the Bardocks Bar to get it an inviting vibe so more popular and busy ,0
 Overpriced in comparison to other hotels we have stayed at ,0
 All good ,0
 N A,0
 Restaurant menu to limited,0
 The open plan bathroom and toilet ,0

 Room was small compared to price ,0
 Breakfast didn t worth the money very expensive and poor service ,0
 The room I booked for the family wasn t within my expectation as I booked for five persons but room was too small for five with only one bathroom If I knew the size of the room is too small I could have taken 2 rooms instead l highly suggest hotel management to allocate adequate room for large family Otherwise the hotel is super excellent ,0
 Terrible pastries and bread at breakfast croissants were dry and old toast was barely toasted Not a five breakfast at all Eggs cooked well but hash brown clearly from frozen Room felt a little cold and fusty bedding didn t smell crisp and clean although it did look clean That said the bed was very comfy and duvet soft Lack of facilities expected for five star hotel no pool or sauna and you had to pay extra for hammam They had recently painted the bathroom or grouted it and it hadn t been done very well white paint had gotten all over the marble looked rough and rushed The hotel was just a bit tired despite what I m sure would have been very grand furnishings in their day Needs some love and care to really hit the 5 star mark doorman fresher lighter warmer rooms and much much better food ,0
 Room was tired a lot of chipped paint Glued surfaces fixtures Looked poorly maintained Bed not as comfortable as a premier inn ,0
 Room on the street can be a bit noisy due to traffic,0
 Room was very small When we went for breakfast there were no seats to sit on as it was too busy ,0
 My husband and I were beginning our honeymoon here and requested an early check in to relax as we had just gotten off the plane The receptionist told us that it was not possible but we had been able to request the option so that was confusing and we would have to wait until at least 1pm We returned at 1pm and she then changed her answer and said not until 2pm And it was not until the strike of 2pm that we were allowed in our room In the future do not offer an early check in option if you are not able to provide one ,0
 The room could have larger waredrobe ,0
 We have continental breakfast included we offered to pay upgrade for full English breakfast was told no Means we did not have breakfast at hotel and went out for breakfast More money spent ,0

 infrastructure old poor shower pressure reception undermanned waited long in order to ask a simple question as a whole group was before us for check in and only one person at reception at around peak moment of 7 pm can be better our room card was also often deactivated arrived at 16th floor at our room didn t work had to go all the way back to the reception ,0
 Bed,0
 When I arrived no door man helped me with 2 luggages the entire lobby and hote has only 1 staff I was a little bit shocked Felt like a family own hotel But after 2 mins some staff show up ,0

 Room is very small Air conditioning very poor ,0
 Room was a bit small ,0
 At least one of the lifts was out of order for the whole four days I was there and a second one was out of order for some of the time The housekeeping times were a little strange either early in the morning when you re stilllon bed or late in the afternoon when you re coming back from being out all day ,0

 The a c did not work for both nights n then when they got us the fan there was insufficient ice available for the fan so we hardly slept for those 2 days as it was very hot The sound on the TV volume did not work A very bad experuence,0
 We decided to upgrade from a double to deluxe double and were severely disappointed Not only was the deluxe room one of the smallest we ve stayed at in this country it was also unclean There were 2 quite big coffee I hope it was anyway stains on the carpet and bath sealant missing mouldy We complained to reception and were told they could not move us because the hotel was full After much negotiation they finally knocked some money off but the size of the room for a Hilton was small ,0
 Room was a little cold and couldn t work out how the heating controls worked or maybe they wernt working at all Only thing that annoyed us slightly Came back after the concert and staff had obviously taken off the draught beer from the bar to make you buy the more expensive bottles 9 00 for a bottle of beer and a coke Draught beers were back on first thing in the morning ,0
 There were some room card issues they were deactivated after only a couple of days and we had to go to the reception and redo them Also one night around 4 AM someone entered our room without knowing that we re inside It was quickly resolved by the reception office The city tax is not included and has to be paid at the checkout ,0
 I found loads of men hair on the bed when I checked in and I had to complain so they came and changed every thing I found men hair in toilet and other disgusting things so so so dirty They claimed it is the laundry but not true I found dirtiness everywhere yukh,0
 Description of rooms Superior Deluxe and Club none of them were applicable to the rooms we were shown The club room should be graded standard,0
 It took 45 minutes to check out as three couples were ahead of us in the queue Location of garage car park was poorly explained and not obvious A minor irritation after a long journey ,0
 The interior style was old Room size and elevator was so small,0
 Thought we had breakfast included but didn t an extremely expensive hotel so did expect to have something like breakfast inlcuded rather than paying so much for a room Exchange rate changed by the time we were there and the difference was HUGE also so pay upfront when booking Not allowed to reserve a table for drinks at the rooftop meaning both nights we went up we could not sit down and therefore weren t allowed to have a drink whilst standing Staff tried to accommodate but we went elsewhere after waiting as we were a group of 11 ,0
 Lack of parking poor and expensive brekfast terible noise at the 7am due to renovation of the hotel lack gowns and slippers ,0

 Bathroom toiletteries a little bit poor,0
 Everything was ok,0
 Having to leave ,0
 No shelf for shampoo etc in shower ,0
 That the spa was an additional charge over and above the room charge the snacks at the guest service were over priced but thats to be expected the view from my window was that of a construction sight but the area is under development and i expect in the coming years that it will be built up and a very good place for travellers to stay just outside the historic Amsterdam ,0
 rooms have carpet bleh thats is old fashioned and unhygienic its time for a bit of an upgrade The bar could become a little cosier ,0
 Somehow managed to use all GB of internet that were included in room price they should have a flat rate internet so that it doesn t matter how much internet you use ,0
 Maid moved stuff around the room one day moved a table across the room moved shoes from one side to the other moved an alarm clock off of the shelf and onto the bed which then resulted in the alarm clock being lost in the laundry although hotel staff contacted us after they found it and are in the process of mailing it to us Chair in room really was t comfortable ,0

 Second rate television and shower didn t drain properly,0
 They didn t replace the tea bags after you used a specific flavor ,0

 A bit small room not corresponding with beautiful pictures however still good ,0
 Poor window view ,0
 Extremely small bedroom the inside of the hotel would need a refresh ,0
 At first a room was given that was lower standard from what had been reserved small bed no noise insulation from the noisy road etc Finding this out at 23 30 arguing with reception and moving things at that time of night was not great We were lucky there was a nice available room and night staff were helpful So the experience turned back being more positive ,0
 Slightly bigger room,0
 Television kept dropping the signal ,0
 Staff were rude and unhelpful especially the duty manager who did not even care that the breakfast was inedible The breakfast was absolutely appalling dried up bread Luke warm coffee cold food that should have been hot Dirty crockery and cutlery seriously terrible probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in any hotel in the world Followed by a duty manager who simply shrugged his shoulders when told how bad the food was as if to say I don t care ,0
 The room needed a makeover Badly worn carpet Decor and materials in bath as well as bedroom very stark industrial in feel ,0
 Breakfast a bit tasteless no seasoning flavour to scrambled eggs and mushrooms,0

 Standard room below average for price plug didn t drain water after a shower took 50 out my account after saying it wouldn t come out,0
 No privacy in bathroom no sofa despite I booked deluxe room the picture is different than reality,0
 The beds are a bit too hard for my taste ,0
 Only thing I didn t enjoy much was a surprise shower while still dressed and running a bath the water suddenly switched itself to the overhead shower unit for some reason Bath plug doesn t seat properly either ,0
 Bathroom too small and the sink was outside the bathroom,0
 The shower door don t close perfectly and wet the bathroom floor,0
 It is far away from city centre If you want to come back from Milan City Centre after 10pm you should take M1 and then bus 67 and then another 1 5 km of walking And it will take 1 5 hours ,0
 Difficulty at check in to get a non microchipped credit card to work due to operator error costing us a great deal of time plus phone calls to the USA ,0

 The size of the room ,0
 Cold water tap seized in bathroom Room too warm,0
 It would be nice if it was a bit cheaper ,0

 You d be lucky to park on street close to the hotel ,0
 The breakfast was excellent However the dining room was often full and a long wait ensued Room was comfortable but rather small The room rate seemed rather high,0
 Minibar a bit expensive,0
 The tram line is next to the hotel The trams running in the early hours of the morning are noisy and may wake you up,0
 Could have free breakfast included as part of the deal,0
 That annoying low handle on the door to the right after the main second entrance I m short so imagine the tall people ,0
 Repeated requests needed to get daily snack plate though compensation given on second day Duvet much too hot for room temperature no hand baisin in toilet,0
 The bed had not been changed from previous guest It actually had human excrement on the pillow and sheets When we spoke to manager he said sorry let me give you breakfast I don t think they acknowledged the severity of this You would not expect this from a B B let alone a top rated hotel The bar area felt like a meat market First hotel I ve ever been in that you don t get tea and coffee making facilities in room Never again ,0
 The pillows were so massive they were uncomfortable My neck hurt all night ,0
 We had to wait to be seated at breakfast,0
 A little bit of information in the room about breakfast and health suite opening times ,0
 The room could do with a bedside lamp ,0
 The only toiletries were shower gel No hairdryer Only used the bar once as the barman kept pouring the drinks flat and at 5 a pint this lack of training was disappointing ,0
 I was staying at the highest floor the room was nice but I would add some more detailes to make it more cozy looking like two little rugs at the sides of the bed would be perfect also the walls are looking quite cold and unattractive so I would put either the wallpaper on it or color it in a bit more warm tone So A few little details would make the room perfect Also the water was leaking right on the floor while showering but it s quite easy to fix I think,0
 Very poor lighting in room,0
 There were no bathrobes ,0
 Not much in local area have to eat and drink in hotel at hotel prices ,0
 Lifts kept breaking down,0
 We liked everything ,0
 Lack of view from the room,0
 There were queues at breakfast some 10 15 minutes wait Did not appear to be any heating in bathroom and the placing of mirror over wash hand basin could be lower I am of short stature and could not use it to do make up etc as could not see in it ,0
 It was all terrible from the delay in checking in to changing the beds into two singles which I had requested the room was smaller than what was stated on the website the bed was uncomfortable and hard the plug in sockets were scattered unevenly around the room which was irritating when trying to plug somthing in The bathroom was vile the size was absolutely tiny and the bathtub was dirty and slightly grimy Later during my stay I was watching television and I get a knock on the door from security saying there s too much noise in the room the television was not even loud the cheek and basic disrespect from staff was terrible disturbing ,0
 Danger and unsafty left Poor wifi The room was feeling wet Therefore I was sick next day Very expensive and don t deserve it ,0
 The shower was terrible and there was no kettle or tea making facilities in the room although there was a free Nespresso machine in the lounge ,0
 N A,0
 problem with hot water in shower on the second morning right as i was checking out i paid over 300 for this hotel booking the basic expectation is a clean room a warm bed and a hot shower It s a shame that the guest experience is ruined because of a failure to deliver the basic needs ,0
 Waiting 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast was dissapointing ,0
 Given dirty room twice prior to getting my final cleaned room,0
 Curtains did not fit properly letting light in early morning ,0
 The staff is extremely rude especially this guy Fabia who is doing most of the check ins After Fabia comes a fat guy and he is even more rude It was scary to be in that hotel all alone Plus rooms are quite shady In short if you are going to stay there alone I would not recommend it ,0
 Very central for my visit,0
 An open TV which allowed streaming of movies from own media devices maybe ,0
 Shuttle bus that was listed like extra when i was doing the reservation but on arrival i was told that is no longer available ,0
 the Bad point the wifi always not working and when you reserved is the most they should to put a password for the internet,0
 Had room 505 between lifts so lot noise Not good sleep Showers not hot enough ,0
 Coffee was not up to scratch Room not naturally aired from outside as you cannot open the windows or doors that they have in place It will do some good to get fresh air into it rather than air conditioning all the time It was set at 24 degrees so i had to ask them to raise it and and they did so by only one degree to 25 Strange subtle odures accompanied by drowsiness at regular intervals ,0
 My only complain is that my room was noisy because of the road outside ,0
 Storage space is limited,0
 No,0
 Room cleaning is done relatively superficial Also in common areas elevator for example for 5 days as it was not given a vacuum cleaner ever It is one of the first impressions that you make it For hotel claims it is not too good ,0
 own gym but did nto need it this time bigger room service menu but did not need it this time own more bikes ,0
 there needs to be frosted glass on the toilet window of room 116 ,0
 a lift or disability access from the car park to reception would be good ,0
 The doorman at door were extremely rude won t help with bag The first night we found a cleaning towel in the bed sheet was disgusting ,0
 Paper thin walls provided no sound insulation from noises emanating from neighbouring rooms or people in the main floor lobby Fortunately things quieted down after 11 pm and we managed a comfortable and restful night s sleep ,0
 We had a room on the lower ground and it was very noisy first thing in the morning when the staff were moving about preparing breakfast etc,0
 Room was small as per most affordable rooms in Europe Could not regulateA C temperature to our liking Bed was adequate but not overly spacious or comfortable ,0
 Getting to and from it by foot involves a lot of walking one way and then the other just to get to the street in front Once on the street a quick cross over to tram stop with very frequent service Not cheap but a lot of Amsterdam is expensive ,0
 Only one set of towels in room no tea or kettle just coffee machine in room had to wait 15 mins for a pot of tea at breakfast no tea spoon with boiled eggs seems petty to charge 2 extra for a cooked breakfast when paying 320 for room,0
 The street was quite noisy around midnight loading of bins in a big truck or something Windows need a good wash ,0
 The staff the worst ever i met with i came from Doha early and they late me stranded because my booking is at 15 pm and every time and then they told me the room i ve had booked was not ready it was a terrible experience,0
 Tv signal was poor,0
 Bathroom required maintenenance in need of update Attitude of some staff was in need of up skilling Restaurant food also expensive fast food Breakfast very expensive for a family of 4 even at the hotel offer price ,0
 The only thing I thought could be improved is the air conditioner in the room The coolest it allows you to go is 19 degrees which was a little to warm for me and my partner ,0
 Not sure why but in the morning for breakfast they wanted us to eat in what resembled a meeting room very dark and boring Yet across the way was a bright and modern eating area with access to an outside courtyard We refused to eat in the boardroom and enjoyed the outside courtyard First Bedroom was ok but clear it was aimed at business people but due to an issue with no Aircon we were moved to a room on floor 6 which was very nice,0
 Our rooms were on the same floor but a long way apart,0
 Location is slightly too far away from the center Hotel not very clean and in need of a shine up Our room overlooked the swimming pool leaving little privacy Could hear everything from neighboring rooms ,0
 n a,0
 Bed was a bit short for my tall husband but he still slept really well Bathroom was cold and had no heating but thats just finding fault because you re insisting O yes and the wifi kept dropping out quite annoying ,0
 The room should have electric kettle,0
 pool,0
 Not enough variety for breakfast and not worth the 20 you can get the same sort of breakfast in a Travelodge or premier inn for less than half the price Also could of done with more light in the room some of the lights went off way too quick I get the energy saving but they could stay on abit longer before turning themselves off,0
 No TV Problem with the conection apparentley as a single traveller this is important Quite far to walk into town Shower needs more power Bathroom shower gel etc is gimmicky and hard to open ,0
 The tv channels were all in French and there was no English subtitles so we didn t have a clue what was happening in shows It would have been nice to have a front view of the hotel instead of a crane as this was our honeymoon but I do understand if that couldn t be done ,0
 A slight odour of cigar smoke not sure where it was coming from though all london hotels were smoke free,0
 Shower over bath flooded the bathroom floor despite our best efforts The room was very cosy OK for us as we were out and about a lot ,0
 Please Italy smile more I know its common there but for other countries it s important D ,0
 We had a superior room but it was still fairly small ,0
 Reception needs to be more organized paperwork takes time The power went out when I connected their iron I had to contact the reception to send a technician to get the power back ,0
 Room clean but rather small ,0
 Limited view in certain rooms Preferred the Deluxe King with street view Thanks Lukasz,0
 Cleaning the room needs to be done in a better way ,0
 Sofa in a broken state and not meeting the standards of the room,0
 Expensive in roof top bar especially as in plastic glasses,0
 The man at the bar didn t seem to really know what the cocktails on the list were wasn t the friendliest man in the world a bit odd to be honest,0
 We booked 5 rooms and some single persons got spacious room with large bed and some couples smaller rooms with narrow bed so staff could use more logic when checking people in No big deal though just a small note ,0
 You have ruined the lobby bar atmosphere Staff mediocre at best occasionally rude Room too small ,0
 Bed was the most uncomfortable bed ever come across in a hotel Side of bed seam broken and sharp Dated decor seriously needs upgrade A real hike to top floor no lift so up spiral stairs with luggage Not easy,0
 Very expensive room service and breakfast ,0
 Really small shower,0
 Aircon Was hardly working,0
 Unwelcoming disaffected reception staff ,0
 Noise you can hear everything in the street or the room next to yours slow elevators complemintory drinking water only for first arrival day conjusted tiny room and toilet even for superior rooms old furniture and carpet smelly rooms room service is it that tasty or great and not advisable expensive for whatever you get Small double beds they are queen size actually ,0
 The smell first floor hall The squeeqy bed Not falsly cgarging extra at the end ,0
 The room was a bit on the small side and it was quite expensive,0
 Breakfast was listed as included but there are no food drink facilities in the hotel at all Told on the 3rd day that they d stopped offering breakfast 2 days ago ,0
 My only complaint is that our coffee mugs weren t changed for the duration of our 4 night stay I don t mind reusing for a few different cups of tea but a new mug every day would have been nice Bathroom was a little small also but well appointed and clean ,0
 Breakfast a little poor staff a little slow Not a good location if visiting central London via train tube bus ,0
 The extractor fan in the bathroom was incredibly noisy The condensation from the shower covered every surface in the room including the inside of the wardrobe and the clothes in it A central London hotel that aspires to attract business travellers should really have a restaurant that serves breakfast earlier than 7 o clock in the morning Rooms really cheaply furnished ,0
 The heating was probably not working very well and it was rather noisy The strong noise coming from upstairs partly due to the insufficient floor insulation from other guests ,0
 The room was nice but definitely too small it could be compared to some of the smallest rooms I ve seen in Japan For the price paid 160 per night I think I should have been able to go on the other side of the bed without having to walk over it Barely had the space to open one single piece of luggage Probably not all their rooms are like this but ours was definitely not comfortable for two people ,0
 Beds to small to hard,0
 Everything was perfect ,0
 The knowledge of some of the staff was poor for example when we checked in we were given no information about the hotel or the surrounding area Also they had trouble getting us a taxi to the airport as they didn t know which company to use Most were quite helpful and one particular lady went out of her way to help us It s a lovely hotel just very quiet ,0
 This is not a 4 star hotel If I had paid more tham 120 euros I would be really upset ,0
 The door key that turns on the electricity is annoying but I understand that wasteful use is expensive ,0
 No windo in allrooms,0
 We ordered off the breakfast menu the first morning it was very slow the 2nd morning it didn t come at all and the waitress said we didn t place an order when we certainly had and it was difficult to get a member of the staffs attention,0
 Asked for champagne glasses 3 times and never recieved them Over priced and spa facilities not included in price Not worth the money that was paid ,0
 Nice place I like the place and coming back,0
 Small lift,0
 cost i suppose it was new year eve,0
 Wifi,0
 room a bit too small,0
 Had room problem on arrival but soon changed All was ok,0
 Having to pay for wifi,0
 1 The bathroom is not clean 2 No change for the bedding 3 dont check the mini bar ,0
 I honestly liked everything during my stay ,0
 No WiFi in the room Super cold bathroom with no heating system One big bed is in fact created from two small ones ,0
 Everything else It lacks the facilities of a four star hotel,0
 The pillows were very uncomfortable and too hard All 4 of them were the same so I didn t have any choice of a softer pillow ,0
 Standard room is sooooo small not even close to being worth the price And because they are soo small they smell like body odor Two adults cannot stay in this room comfortably Probably fine for one adult but the smell is still there They need to rip out the carpets regularly in those rooms Bathroom is so small it stays wet the entire stay Hot tub in spa was cold and the hammam smelled like dirty socks ,0
 Front desk was often too busy especially at check in Expensive ,0
 High fee for a wifi connection is no longer the practise today,0
 Breakfast wasn t the best most items cold hash browns stale and bacon mostly fat,0
 There was no sign of the refreshment in the room so as very thirsty on arrival went downstairs with 6year old and were charged 8 55 for 2pots of tea Then on returning to room and going to unpack found the kettle etc hidden away in cupboard which I found most annoying especially as my granddaughter was quite tired and we had to wait some time for our teas to be served ,0
 30 for one night s parking behind the hotel was expensive The member of staff on reception on arrival was unsmiling and we did not feel welcomed though our son who arrived separately and was presumably greeted by a different member of staff had a much warmer welcome ,0
 The key cards seemed to be very sensitive and suddenly stopped working then to enter my room had to go back to the reception and get the key activated again The staff was very helpful all the way though ,0
 Room to hot and too noisy if you opened the window,0
 for this second time i wish i had a bigger bathroom or shower instead of tub ,0
 The double bed is actually two single beds combined it s uncomfortable if you are used to sleep in the middle of the bed ,0
 The website led us to believe that breakfast served was included in the price not separate,0
 Shower was not working properly and the water was flooding the room no coffee or tea facilities in the room no ironing board no mini fridge or a safe in the room either ,0
 soundproof,0
 There is no extractor fan which would seem ideal when an open plan bathroom faint smell of damp entering the room had to air this out Put do not disturb on the first day came back to a pile of new towels on our bed with a note that they didnt tidy up as DND was on but had to access for security reasons didn t feel comfortable with this Our hairdryer wasnt working and actually smoked when turned on I reported this and was questioned why I only reported this on my second day my partner towel dries and I only wash my hair every other day No milk provided in the free tea and coffee facilities so after brewing two teas on day 1 realized we couldn t drink them Forgot to buy milk whilst out so on his birthday morning decided to order 2 x extortionate pots of tea at 4 25euros each doesnt mention in menu or hotel info anything about the additional 3 50euro charge for using room service 12 euros for 2 pots of tea id have been happy with just the milk pods or a cup but wouldnt have bothered if I knew about the additional charge Overall lovely hotel but could be so much better if it wasnt for these little issues ,0
 WIFI was very bad hotel needs updating,0
 I reserved two rooms but when check in they said I booked only one room The staff at check in was not very nice but the other staff was better No place for drop off luggages when we came by car Communication via email but got no reply,0
 The hotel fire alarm going off at midnight til half past one on our first night ,0
 Wifi should be available everwhere and not an extra ,0
 I have travelled to many countries and stayed in many different hotels Hilton Metropole will NOT be a hotel I stay in again We stayed there 5 nights and only after the third request and very frustrated they fixed the air condition in the room It was only the last night of our stay that we had a cool temperature in the room and were able to sleep last week average London temperature was 91 degree so you can imagine how uncomfortable we were Hallways were very dirty food from room service would stay there all day and carpets were not vacuumed regularly First night after a long flight we had to get 3 sets card keys replaced to be able to enter into our rooms We checked in at 5 and got into our rooms finally at 7 30 PM Good luck if you need the elevators some time the wait is 10 minutes or more I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANY ONE ,0
 The lift,0
 I liked of everything ,0
 The media station didn t work in our room and nobody came to help us even though we asked 4 times One staff member didn t even seem to know what I was taking about when I told her it was nt working Not ideal when it s part of the reason you booked the hotel We also got asked 3 times if we wanted to move to their new hotel in a different location which we didn t and it became annoying being asked I just wanted the room spec to be what it is described as and for things to be working or fixed ,0
 rooms are elegants but very small,0
 We are pretty happy with everything and was really happy during our stay For people who wants hard bed might want check again ,0
 Cash free hotel,0
 Room was very cold couldn t sleep,0
 Walls are like from paper you can actually hear every move and sound from next rooms and when somebody clean the room because they drag chairs ,0
 Small room overpriced unusual to pay before the visit,0
 The rooms should have a proper fridge We had food and milk which went off v,0
 Extremely Noisy with traffic outside Had to wear ear plugs Room was super tight so trying to manage two large bags was cumbersome Had to ask twice to put some pillow covers on two of our pillows ,0
 No bar but there were plenty in the area ,0
 The room we were given after an upgrade was close to the lifts which did detract from the quietness expected ,0
 Needs a bit more of an evening meal selection heard a lot of people being told their meals weren t available especially no curry on curry night ,0
 breakfast too expensive no facilities for making coffee or tea in the room,0
 Coffee appalling breakfast would have been better with less choice higher quality Common areas need to be modernised,0
 The wifi is slow When I commented on it the staff tried their best to speed it up Which was great service The windows of our room was to the sea and it was not possible to block out the morning sun with the curtains ,0
 Comfort,0
 Parking station located below hotel was very expensive,0
 I did not love the location the building was a little confusing at first ,0
 If the restorant was operational inspite of the public holidays ,0
 The breakfast was a let down The scrambled eggs were poor and there was not enough choice Waitresses were very friendly though and tea pigs tea was great ,0
 Room was a little musty but otherwise seemed fine,0
 Rusty radiator shower full of scaling missing shoe brush breakfast poor in varieties Paid parking you re serious ,0
 Old fashioned hotel for people over 50 I was really disappointed with a gym almost no equipment at all Not everywhere in the room I had a WiFi and if I had it was cutting every second minute Moreover a lot of noisy Chinese ,0
 Brown decor could do with brightening up,0
 Couldn t fault it at all,0
 Bed was hard as rock ,0
 The food in the restaurant was poor for the money there were no facilities for obtaining coffees or teas when we returned from the concert at the Albert Hall about 10 45 or anywhere where we could obtain a snack Some of the staff had difficulty with understanding our language English The supply of tea coffee and milk was totally inadequate and a chocolate drink could be added as an aid to sleep ,0
 The 24hr room service menu wasn t actually available when calling the front desk many of the options were not available It also seemed the person at front desk was making the sandwich and not dedicated kitchen staff It took him 20 mins to go to the kitchen to check supplies and then another 20 mins to ring me to tell me what he didn t have I was pretty disappointed at that ,0
 Era un tercer piso sin ascensor,0
 A bit of a walk to get to the tube but not a reason to not stay there ,0
 We had problems with our TVs but the staff came and dealt with it very swiftly ,0
 The room for 3 person are not very big And another very bad surprise is with Booking Hotel i Made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused,0
 Everything was terrible Room was very uncomfortable bed was very old it hurts your spine pillows were ancient even the toilet papers are the cheapest terrible ones we paid a fortune to holidayinn I don t care about the location it was not a fact for me I needed to rest because of my health and everything was just so very bad and uncomfortable you ask for mozerrela avacado sandwich they bring cheddar and avocado tasteless sandwich room and windows were very dusty heating never worked you have to call the reception they turn it on for you but mine never worked house keeping never changed the sheets I stayed for 7 nights and they changed it on the last day when I finally had an argument it was a robbery I will never go back i know what hotel managment is very well my family background comes from this Bussines I grew up in hotels I am sad to see HolidayInn like this cheating on people terrible ,0
 As with all London hotels it was expensive but that s London Hotels for you ,0
 The restaurant needs a complete overhaul Don t feel relaxed or comfortable while dinning It s too like a staff canteen No character Like being in a railway cafe It would be nice to have a lounge to relax in and enjoy a drink ,0
 My wife thinks the towels were not very clean,0
 Nil,0
 A bit of distance from the old town but i had a vienna card so was ok for me and my friend ,0
 The cold water from the basin tap was warm so brushing teeth was a bit unpleasant also the lights kept going out due to a faulty keycard holder mid shower was not the best ,0
 Room service did take nearly an hour so order early Bedding and room was clean but there was some old napkins in the drawer ,0
 Room to a smaller size if you have big suitcases and more clothes it will be a challenge where to keep all To change bin in the bathroom and the plastic table for towels was broken and kept falling down Does not cost that much to change it but it would give extra value for the room itself during breakfast guys were way to fast to take the plates felt like we have to rush to eat and go out Very friendly thought but would of appreciated more relaxed breakfast without rushing ,0
 Everything good,0
 Rudeness of staff member who checked me in Talked to another member of staff about me like I wasn t there Room slightly dated,0
 I am really just looking for things that are bad but the only thing i can say is We stayed there 5 days and by the 5th day i did wish a little that they changed up there breakfast a little ,0
 I can only recommend roof over smoking area was nice but wet ,0
 I didn t like the housekeeping but once I complained they improved a little I wish it could be perfect like everything else was ,0
 A little expensive,0
 The hotel was crowded It created uncomfortable atmosphere during breakfast The worst was to find additional cost tourist city tax 5 euro person It was written in small letters in the notes to the booking instead of being included in the price shown at the booking site When a tourist is tired and has limited time for a hotel selection such hidden cost are typically remain unnoticed This undermines the credibility of booking com ,0
 This hotel was not our style Too noisy all night long Very dim lighting and mirrors in rooms was not for us This hotel was much bigger and busier than we like However staff was great helping with bags calling reliable taxi and answering all questions Very friendly Location was close to all transportation ,0
 Room was cold and had to ask for it to be heated ,0
 Some rooms bathrooms are very tired and old fashioned in need of a refurb ,0
 The hotel is not right near the centre of the city though shopping is nearby The room had an issue with a smell from the air conditioning vent though it was eventually fixed ,0
 Our bathroom sink drained very slowly due to a poor adjustment on the height of the metal plug Simple enough I fixed it myself instead of calling the management but I wondered why wasn t this reported earlier to a supervisor by the cleaning staff ,0
 Crowd in front hotel,0
 Room cold due to inadequate heating ,0
 The images in the room parking and thier massage ,0
 Location is a bit far from things to do,0
 the hotel and furniture is old it s maximum 3stars,0
 Breakfast eggs to watery ,0
 Everything is just too small I couldn t use the bathroom comfortably because the toilet was small It sat in the gap between the shower screen and sink unit and there simply wasn t enough space for comfort This was a big put off ,0
 If there s service for transferring customers or even just their bags from the Centraal would be awesome It s not a very easy walk from Centraal with luggage and yet it s not long enough for taking a cab The bathing bowl was a bit tall ,0
 Decor was old carpets looked like they needed replacing shower leaked over bathroom,0
 Small beds minute duvet on bed average food expensive ,0
 Three times we asked to refill the coffe and twice to have clean towels provided for a four star this should be automatic done daily ,0
 It is really 2000 s style It has to be updated with renovation,0
 too far from a metro 15 min walk,0
 If you have a child you should not stay in Villoreal You have to prefer staying La Rambla Hotel cleanliness is so good but bathroom can change a swimpool after having shower Toilet door is made of glass but it is not closed because of wrong dimensions Everbody sees you in front of the door Foods and breakfasts are poor Room was so dark and has no good aircondition All of us are ill now We are not satisfied at all ,0
 Only the price ,0
 Reception check in area not clear staff on the phone with back to entrance so they didnt notice us walk in Bit noisy in the morning outside room ,0
 Our room was at the top of the hotel One small window The room was very warm but they gave us a fan And they had someone to take our cases to the room which we were greatful for ,0
 You have to pay a city tax that is not included in the stay price and an 8 euro day parking fee even if you have a booking with them ,0
 The shower was broken and we had no tea cups in our room on arrival ,0
 Perhaps a little overpriced unless you can get a good deal ,0
 The breakfast was unfortunately expensive Better priced just outside hotel ,0
 Breakfast too expensive,0
 Please be aware that there is major road construction going on right outside the hotel No one warned me about this when I booked the room and it is a major nuisance One night they worked all the way through the night That s right LOUD road construction going in at 2 3 4 in the morning If you are looking for sleep I wouldn t take the chance with this hotel especially for what you are paying to stay here until the construction is finished ,0
 Rather limited breakfast Obscure view Shower not functioning properly ,0
 Sometimes shower leaked over bath edge breakfast wasn t great with buffet segregated at different stations,0
 Very expensive for what you get to eat Breakfast is over priced ,0
 Bad AC The Cleaning stuff are not taking the used towels No iron No Coffee Machine,0
 Location not ideal a bit far from the town center,0
 Did not like the fact that we had to pay parking charges as residents We have never encountered this in other hotels ,0
 Room with small window on last floor To access the room you needed to open two additional doors cross some stairs etc ,0
 The staff seems unprofessional and cold ,0
 All good A bit pricey but it is central Amsterdam and at a busy time,0
 We had asked for a twin and were told it was but it was made up as a Super King double which was ok although we are friends travelling together we decided not to bother to ask them to change it,0
 The service of the staff at the breakfast and during dinner was really slow not very friendly and willing to help Though we stayed in a nice room with a king bed there was no room to move around no chair and small table to place a coffee and sit to relax The loby of the hotel has no sofas where one can sit and relax or wait for friends ,0
 The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience,0
 We returned one day late afternoon with our parents and the room was not made up yet ,0
 Hammam facility doesn t meet my expectations so I cancelled the reservation ,0
 Not a criticism but worth noting As our room was in the basement we were not able to get a connection to the free wi fi If you really need wi fi ask for a room above ground ,0
 Breakfast did not impress Three types of cereal milk and toast from Tesco for 16 GBP I would expect a nice continental buffet from a place at this level,0
 There was no tea and coffee in the room There was no fridge in the room although we discovered later we could have paid for one This caused a problem as we had medication which should be kept in a fridge and the reception would not take it to put in their fridge ,0
 We requested a double room when booking but were given a twin Reception staff were quite argumentative regarding swapping said there were no doubles left in the whole hotel 25 floors of rooms ok then if you say so They eventually relented and gave us an accessible room with a double bed which was ok but had a very low bath and sink due to the nature of the room They did bring us toothpaste up though as we d forgotten ours ,0
 The beds were a bit hard We got used to them Otherwise the rooms were bigger and nicer than expected ,0
 Room is very small Toilet is like a small box very samll Hand washing is out of toilet and no privacy in it like cleaning your nose or brushing your teeth The mirror in front of hand washing has light on top of it so it is annoying when you look to mirror,0
 Mini bar prices,0
 Having to come home ,0
 Small bathroom and noisy,0
 The price seems to be steep compared to the rooms,0
 The room is quite small ,0
 I genuinely cannot think of anything ,0
 not the best part of the city at night quite many beggars etc nicer shops at least 5 blocks away almost no TV channels which are not Italian,0
 Wasn t easy to find the carpark,0
 The restaurant was rather overpriced the portions small the food average Charging 15 95 to watch a recent movie release is also pretty steep ,0
 Room very small and location central but right at end of all the sex shops ,0
 noisy ventilation,0
 Room came with Tea and Coffee but no coffee and no milk had to go to reception both mornings to get milk but other than that it was great ,0
 Hotel was very busy at breakfast and not very well organised,0
 Location was a bit far out from city and the area around the hotel was very much deserted with unfinished buildings and unoccupied office blocks ,0
 Having to pay for WiFi We were travelling for over a month and stayed at 6 different accommodations in the UK this was the only place we had to pay for WiFi Also receiving an email on the day we were leaving NZ telling us to update our credit card details or our accommodation may be cancelled We did not receive an email like that from any other source ,0
 Only slight issue was that our bedroom overlooked the back of the concert hall so on the Saturday night loud music could be heard apart from that it was peaceful and quiet for the other 3 nights ,0
 better if the escalator will obtain by room key for safety,0
 everything 100 ,0
 Alcohol is too expensive at the hotel bar ,0
 Lack of a face flannel in the bathroom and a press down bath plug that didn t really work,0
 Room cleaning is very very very bad,0
 The hotel is overpriced for what you get The rooms are not comfortable and quiet small The atmosphere is very cold and unpleasant The swimming pool on the rooftop is small ,0
 Bathroom was very tired My towel had a hole in it and was very worn and tired,0
 Air conditioner is quite noisy,0
 Staff were polite enough but lacked abit of personality,0
 As I traveled with my mother of 50 I feel obliged to include her opinion as well She was disappointed in the toilet paper I kid you not and that no toiletries were provided Breakfast was good but could have been better in some aspects for example the Br tchen rolls buns were horrible All in all she expected a little more from a four star hotel I guess What we both noticed was that the cleaning staff was out very early every morning They were very talkative which really is not great with the doors being so badly soundproofed The same goes for some of the other hotel guests but you cannot blame the hotel for this ,0
 Excellent food at breakfast but not well managed ,0
 People at the reservation office weren t too flexible and helpful for the price you pay you think they d be more considerate ,0
 None,0
 Third bed was basically a converted couch ,0
 While the hotel is in a classy neighborhood and on a very quiet street it s not on a metro station Staying there in the winter made it not fun to walk back and from the metro station 8 minute walk We ended up taking taxis from around the corner there are plenty in front of Hotel Plaza Athenee ,0
 We were given room 1 off reception and it is tiny tiny which we kind of expected what we did not expect is that there are no windows and it is like sleeping in a dark box Very uncomfortable The staff apologised but were full so we couldnt be moved If you are are claustrophobic avoid this room ,0
 The room I was given was rather noisy Next to the changing room for pool and in front of the pool so I couldn t open the curtains during the day ,0
 Bar food,0
 we must spare much money in credit card because the hotel take guaranty so much we stayed 2 night with 3 room they took euro 2200,0
 There are a lot missing things,0
 street is very noisy at Saturday night and it interferes sleeping Bed s mattress is over used which makes it a little less comfort ,0
 Very poor or no mobile cell coverage in the room,0
 With being only overnight we did not have any qualms ,0
 The price if the food,0
 the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries ,0
 Our stay was too short ,0
 Our only misgiving although out of the control of the hotel itself would be the vagrants encamped across from the front entrance ,0
 No food after 10 pm or room service,0
 Not applicable,0
 There was a minor bit of disrepair on the surface of the bathroom but only so minor that I didn t notice it until the 4th day Could be a bit out of the way for people wanting to go between hotel and city centre multiple times during the day but only a 15 20 minute metro and they run every 10 minutes ,0
 The bed is too soft After 3 nights my back pained ,0
 The bar staff They need to get a grip and grow up Immature snooty wastes of spaces ,0
 Smell of cigarette smoke in public areas,0
 Room a bit small but ok for just one night Would definitely want something bigger for longer stay Would definitely book again,0
 Air conditioning not working No ceramic cups for tea No milk provided for tea Reception staff aloof with superior attitude,0
 Price of breakfast and lack of communal space,0
 Wifi was a bit temperamental and there was a small que to be seated at breakfast ,0
 Several problems with the wifi connection getting dropped we use an AirMac which the staff suggested might be the problem ,0
 too noisy its a hotel for ppl who loves clubbing and partying,0
 Little bit far from town ,0
 We weren t told that the only spa facility open was the pool and the sauna but we had already paid and had to find out ourselves when entering the spa area ,0
 The concierge needs to be a little more intuitive about their customers and more engaging,0
 Old outdated The mattresses were thin and feel the springs digging in the back Lighting panels had dead insects Paid for an upgrade as we had no choice to get a better mattress ,0
 We couldn t stay longer than two nights,0
 It is near the hospital so many sirens throughout the night but the rooms are pretty sound proof ,0
 Wasn t keen on the TV which is an Apple Mac I would rather have a widescreen TV Breakfast expensive we went to the regency cafe which cost 10 for the two of us ,0
 Concierge didn t help much Not smile at all Old Asian lady one,0
 The roof terrace is only a few chairs and sofas on the roof The room is quite small but it was totally ok for my needs ,0
 Very expensive poor breakfast if we compare with the price for one night,0
 Maybe a few maps and directions of the city in reception area ,0
 Wellness section is for extra price maybe just the only bad news for bookers but no more complaining ,0
 N a,0
 Location not great,0

 1 far from the tube about 15 min 2 No place for your toilet articles in the bathroom 3 No dinning room,0
 hard beds,0
 I thought a TV in the bathroom was luxurious so ran a deep bath to enjoy it but it didn t work unfortunately ,0
 Only thing that hotel really doesn t have control of is a lot of street noise at night all through the night until the morning when not raining I would stay here again but ask for interior room not facing street ,0
 The duvet seemed to small for the bed also no welcome cookie that you usually get from doubletree Hilton ,0
 I was served on Sat morning by a girl that was not happy to be working and this came across She barely sat us down then went away after 10 minutes I had to call her and request coffee and tea s I then had to ask later for toast All in all not happy with the service We therefore decided to have breakfast at an alternative venue on Sun ,0
 he furniture is not clean and in a bad shape The bath room facilities should be checked and repaired,0
 As most hotels in central Amsterdam they are overpriced This hotel is no exception To pay an extra EUR29 per day for the breakfast buffet on top of the already high room rate is just ridiculous The buffet did not look that great to suggest such exorbitant rate would be justified I only had breakfast in the hotel one morning and instead just had breakfast for less than half the price in one of the cafes nearby Or simply grab some nice food and a coffee from one of the nearby bakeries The room was overlooking one of the streets with restaurants and bars so Thu Sun night usually means drunk people yelling off the top of their voices until 5am in the morning The room s windows weren t sealed that well to cancel out the noise In fact the first night I got up twice to check that all the windows were closed completely which they were but it was just that noisy ,0
 Not enough beverages in room,0
 No baked bean at breakfast ,0
 No comment to make everything was excellent,0
 Woken up by banging and drilling from work being done next door When the lady came to clean our room she left a big bag of rubbish in our room that wasn t ours On the morning of check out house keeping wanted to clean our room at 10 15am check out not till 12noon ,0

 Old hotel and only one lift for the whole hotel The lift reaches up to 4th floor for the 5th floor which is the last you need to use the staires,0
 breckfast ,0
 The people in the room next door were VERY noisy in the small hours of the morning ,0
 As a wheelchair user unfortunately the facilities I require where not in the same room If I could blend two of the rooms one with the suitable bed and one with the suitable bathroom it would be perfect At the moment is there is not one room which fully suits my needs However the staff do their best to accommodate,0
 The staff was not very pleasant neither provided enough information when was asked There was no tea or coffee bag was provided,0
 Poor language capabilities among the non reception related staff extremely hard in conference business area Tried to order a tray with small food sandwiches I could as well have ordered a trip to planet Mars ,0
 That they make me wait until 4 pm to get my room,0
 The location is not the most convenient for visiting downtown Although 10 minutes walk from the subway with luggage became a great effort Also for the days we stayed it was kind of pricey ,0
 Unfriendly staff long time waiting check out in the mornings,0
 Old furniture as well as I couldn t see from the window as the mechanism to put up the curtain was broken Very difficult to orientate till you get to your room Wifi just for one application It means that only one person could use it ,0
 The luggage locker keeper was morose Air conditioner was not enough It was very weak to climate and didn t heat us ,0
 Security is slightly exaggerated cannot use stairs and need card for elevator which is standard but hard to use in this hotel A bit off the main sights but not a major thing given good connection to public transport,0
 No tea or coffee facilities in room ,0
 Fortunately we brought extra phone chargers of course a converter as the sole available outlet was near the floor in the kitchenette I m recommending that they install power strips in the rooms but best to be prepared ,0
 Just a little further out than expected but would be perfect for the airport ,0
 Didn t have free parking like what was advertised Think the bar drinks where Rey expensive,0
 The price was higher than I would have expected for this kind of hotel but it was a busy time and for a work convention so it was market rates ,0
 Wifi Only 30 minutes free A Chinese takeaway left in the fridge from the previous guests ,0
 There were a lot of stairs up to our room The wi fi signal was poor ,0
 Price was high,0
 Room was rather small Bed wasn t comfortable with one one pillow each and a sheet for a duvet Very basic not what I was expecting for my first time staying in a London hotel More suitable for business travels ,0
 Some of the fixtures and fittings were a bit tired I think the hotel cld do with some upgrades,0
 Breakfast was not as expected of a hotel of such a rating The dining was quite cramped when staff are attending to the next customer their backsides with very short skirts are almost touching the next table Tea coffee were cold eggs not served to the specified or requested consistency sausages were cold poorly prepared It s our 3rd stay at the hotel this was the worst we ve seen it Something has changed because we ve never experienced this before ,0

 Room very small needs updating poor decor not good,0
 Can t fault it,0
 Colour changing ceiling light over the bed didn t work went down to reception to be told someone would come and sort it out No one came to room to fix it Following morning asked again to be told those lights are no longer used and went on to tell us why If that s the case these lights should not be in the hotel room description Things like that really bug me Was told there was a shuttle bus to the train station when I checked in and told the times I was not told you had to book in for the shuttle service though ,0
 Breakfast room was cramped and the items on offer were limited or not available milk Paid for Executive Club room but not sure what was executive about it and where the extra went Also limited staff on reception were on the phone more than they were greeting helping guests The only attentive member of staff was a young guy on the door as I was leaving ,0
 I didn t realize 100 added on at check in to cover any extras I didn t use it and my account has still not been recredited ,0
 The breakfast is expensive even for Paris standard Rooms are little and hot water broke for 2 days ,0
 Terrible internet,0
 It wasn t finished being built but when it is it will be perfect ,0
 The air conditioning was pre set and not easy to change the small pool was not open but this was not a problem Make sure you put a do not disturb sign on the door otherwise you will be woken up at 8 30 am,0
 i dont,0
 Building site next door,0
 N A,0
 No parking place But there is one close to the hotel for about 25 daily ,0
 The hotel has no air condition lucky for us the weather was great Room is not very big,0
 The price of bottle watered nearly 5 euros for medium size bottle ,0
 bathroom,0
 Everything was perfect,0
 Slighty stern staff prefer pre paid rather than on arrival,0
 Very small room even with an upgrade But this is common in London unless you pay for a suite Otherwise rooms very high standard,0
 Being picky our shower head needed a good descale it was a bit like being squirted with a water pistol but apart from that and the slightly hard mattress everything was great To be fair these things wouldn t prevent me staying again ,0
 The mouse running around reception was not a good start the staff were rude and very unhelpful the toilet in the room was not entirely clean no apology for the mouse incident ,0
 Probably would have preferred being closer to the centre but it was still easy to get the tram in,0
 Internet is very poor,0
 Only slight problem was that the air conditioner seemed to turn on seemingly at random including at 4am ,0
 The junior suite had a double bed but no seats to sit on Two cheap metal stools by the 1 metre by about 800 mm fitted table It did not match in any way the images on their website There was only one staff member to check us in and he was answering phone calls at the same time We had to wait about 20 minutes before we could be checked in The one bedroom apartment had a sofa bed in the eating area but the double bed was in a room so narrow that the walls were touching either side of the bed It could only be accessed by climbing in from the bottom end of the bed ,0
 smells bad,0
 Bathroom could do with improving and modernising,0
 Very small bathrooms More options for breakfast would be nice ,0
 Needed extra milk but that was sorted through reception needed more bar staff in the sky bar took a while to be served,0
 My cosy room on this occasion was much more cosy than previous stays Info from computers at Reception always seem to confuse the staff there ,0
 Wifi extremely poor,0
 If there were alot of restaurants and shopping store next to the hotel Parking is too expensive need to be reconsidered for fare value especially for descending for example a week,0
 No restaurant or bar As a single woman on my own this can be intimidating to venture out at nigh time,0
 didn t try breakfast can t rate p,0
 I honestly would not change a thing,0
 A bit expensive,0
 The shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet,0
 Half depth elevator,0
 The pools are a joke they are very small the room service is bad we ordered a pizza and it looked like a frozen pizza just put in the microwave the location is far from the major points of interest in Barcelona You have a metro station near the hotel but you have to take at least 10 15 station to reach a point of interest ,0
 I was unable to take a shower at 6 30am as the water was cold By 7 am it was fine The single room was really too small It was difficult to move freely ,0
 Could have done with a couple of hooks in the bedroom to hang winter coats that were too long for the wardrobe ,0
 The staff was rude and ruined our first holiday experience in the uk The room was in the basement which was dark and creepy We felt that we were descriminated as no other guests had basement room other than us Will not stay here again ,0
 Toilet was a bit dated The heater air conditioning was a bit too cold all the time ,0
 Old building needs refurbishment ,0
 Knightsbridge is bad traffic all the time ,0
 The rooms don t appear to be a 4 star hotel Room isolation is very bad hears everything ,0
 If the hotel is used to go to London City Airport there is no Shuttle and the only way really is a 10 taxi ,0
 Expensive parking and breakfast price,0
 Twin Room is too small for movement Inconvenient for those with big and heavy luggage need to carry up the steps Would expect ramp available to push roll up and down luggage ,0
 Breakfast steep even for London alternative takeaway better price would be great ,0
 Small room,0
 Could use a bit of sprucing up But very clean ,0
 Lack of information on arrival for room service and concierge,0
 The mini bar machines in the rooms they are vending machines and no fridges The drinks are not cold and are out of date Tip dont get cold drinks sodas from the bar or machines 2 50 for a 200ml bottle Go down to the car park use the vending machine for the same price get a 500ml bottle Also the resturant is only a bjffett style for 29 50 felt the place was a little expensive but nice if you want something special ,0
 The rooms could of had a little more lighting and a headboard so people don t have to sit apart from each other in order for them to lean against something Secondly I was asked to pay 50 deposit which I was told I was receive back when I checkout The staff member didn t make it clear that there would be a 5 61 city tax which I understand was on the terms and conditions but people don t usually read them therefore I think the staff members should give customers a little reminder about that to avoid any confusion Also I borrowed an adaptor and the lady that gave me it again didn t tell me there would be a charge to borrow it She handed me it and asked for my room number and that was it I was then told when getting the 50 deposit back that there was a charge which I was not happy with and I wasn t going to pay it as I wasn t aware Again staff should be clear about any payments and extra charges that will be given to their customers However in response to this a gentleman behind the reception gave me a complimentary shuttle ride to the airport which I was grateful for ,0
 Upon check in the front desk was not very friendly,0
 Room could have been a bit bigger with tea and coffee in room ,0
 The room was a little small especially for getting around with a walker No view although our limited expanse from the window did provide some plants on adjacent rooftop and unobtrusive exterior walls of surrounding buildings ,0
 Being 40 mins away from central Amsterdam 10 min walk to the Metro and a 30 min ride to Centraal Station ,0
 the dated room design didnt match the modern architecture of the lobby or outside presentation ,0
 Could hear train street noise ,0
 Little more info on food Maybe breakfast menu if they have one we are still not sure Weatherspoons next door though so we were okay ,0
 Very expensive poor serivce staff are not friendly at all They can not provied iron to your room and the lundary service expensive and will take long time They take long long time to answer the phone calls,0
 Bathroom could have been cleaner ,0
 Everything good ,0
 The corridors could have been a little wider for luggage A better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and The tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too However apart from that everything was perfect ,0
 Bedroom very tiny no room for 1 suitcase ,0
 The bed was very squeaky ,0
 The bed in room 10 is way to small for 2 grown men In March I was shown a completely different room when I stopped by to See the accomadations For our stay in December I was told that we will have a twinroom ,0
 Limited bottled water in rooms Wine list very expensive quality of wine only average in my opinion No swimming pool,0
 They kept charging my credit card on amounts that I didn t know what was about,0
 Decor in the hallways was tired ,0
 Breakfast very poor,0
 room smaller than last years but would not put me off as this is my 5th stay at a double tree hotel,0
 The bathroom floor was very slippery when wet ,0
 The rooms are tired but you are working on that I looked at the rates for June and wondered whether I can still afford coming to stay with you ,0
 No drinking water offered for free in the room No kettle in the room Even 3 star hotels offer at least a small bottle of water and there is a possibility to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room with no extra charge for it After a long day outside this was missed when returning to the room No iron Personally I think the price was too high for the the way the rooms where furnished I expected more of the hotel Rooms look better on the pictures then in real I have seen two rooms during the stay my friend s and mine My room was nicer Cosiness was missed It smelled paint in the corridors The breakfast was poor The hotel is actually quite nice My opinion is given according to the price paid Way to high for the quality provided ,0
 Buffet breakfast a bit chaotic perhaps due to so many concurrently arriving for the Sunday 9 15 9 45ish slot Made worse by poorly arranged breakfast bars that resulted in people criss crossing repeatedly before being able to return to their respective tables ,0
 Room too small ,0
 Our room was a little small with two large cases although the bathroom was plenty big enough And the bar closes at 11 ,0
 Small rooms for the money ,0
 Every thing Price is too high compair to the hotle service and room size Paied parking I orderd water and they said to me there will be charges on deleivery to your room 4 Very selly and shame on holiday in,0
 The price fluctuation during my stay was very upsetting I was in London for medical treatment The room type I wanted wasn t available for my entire stay I had to book again 1 or 2 days at a time and every day the price changed for the same room Eventually the hotel didn t have availability and I moved to another local hotel At least I was able to book there for the remainder of my stay with no problem ,0
 The breakfast was cold The room wasn t ready at time requested The room wasn t the standard we expect when paying a lot of money for a night ,0
 The room they provide me was for whilechair and it was not really friendly for me Because I was not used to use short of accessories and was not handy for me ,0
 Busy out of the front of the hotel on the friday night About 10 minutes walk or so from Vauxhal underground not bad but could be closer ,0
 Weird hotel entrance feels like a hostel The wifi is free but goodluck connecting or streaming The room was small The AC is very hard to deal with No restaurant for breakfast,0
 d cor quite dated beds not very comfortable,0
 Mini bar empty Pedestrian access poor from station Should not allow mobile phones in bars or dining room ,0
 Staff could not be bothered about the continuos noise from my Bathroom Dirty this hotel needs to be condemned ,0
 Room is a bit tight a big swivel chair took up far too much room No separate shower air con was far too noisy too use Powdered milk was awful Dutch coffee milk would be a much better option Quite pricey but you pay for the location I suppose,0
 Ac noise which perturbated my sleep in room 804,0
 Tight room,0
 Breakfast used to be better when it wasn t a buffet ,0
 The artwork on the wall it s not to everyone s taste Also breakfast was ridiculously expensive so we didn t have it A little far from the centre of Milan so not always easy to get back late after a night out or to leave early for a flight ,0
 Rooms are a bit small but ok Breakfast at 16 50 euros each was exorbitant for a buffet especially as a request for an omelet was said to be impossible ,0
 Few if any drawers in the bedroom so storage had to be in the luggage or hung in the wardrobe ,0
 N a,0
 small room,0
 Bathroom could do with some TLC Little bit dated ,0
 The entrance did not do it justice,0
 service,0
 It is very noisy which you expect but the rooms at the front of the hotel are difficult to sleep in There was shouting at partying outside until 6am on Saturday The gym is extremely small The general pool and spa day is great however don t go here if you re a gym bunny The worst part of the trip was the unhelpful front desk staff I asked to check out at 12 30 but was told this wasn t possible We asked them to bring our bags down and keep them at reception but they didn t bother ,0
 Staff with vacuum cleaner on terrace was noisy and slightly premature whilst we were finishing breakfast but they soon stopped when we asked Other than that wish we could have stayed longer ,0
 It was not clear enough how to get the room cleaned up it is not a complaine but maybe it helps if someone explanes it by check in All good great excellent ,0
 The staff are rude We were given a room with a blocked sink broken toilet door and lights that didn t work I raised this with staff but it wasn t fixed and they still expected us to pay full price Our room had a tiny window behind a wall that looked out to a loading bay ,0
 We were a party of 6 in London for a special occasion we all had deluxe rooms I am unsure what extra s we got for the additional expence Hence because we paid a little more for better accommodation this has impacted on the overall review There is room for improvement As a regular traveller UK International I cannot understand why large hotel chains in the UK do not provide free Wi Fi for everyone The pillows were very soft there was only 1 spare The info states dressing gowns and slippers are available we only had one of each in a twin room The shower was disappointing as the water pressure was not very powerful and the water did not get very hot Our water glasses were not washed and the coffee making facilities were not returned to the cupboard when the room was cleaned The maids knocked quite early circa 8am to see if the room could be made up We acknowledge that we should probably have put the do not disturb notice on the door this really could be organised so that rooms are identified as vacant once people having booked out Our TV did not work on our first night We reported a fault and someone came to look at this He was unable to rectify the problem and said he would come back with another cable and didn t We reported this again the next morning and this was fixed whilst we were out for the day All equipment should be checked when the room is prepared for the next guests Breakfast is available in Jamie s and is quite expensive We asked if there was a Weatherspoon s in the area and the staff did not know An internet search revealed there were 2 a short walk away Staff having better local knowledge would be helpful A covered smoking area would be good A lot of people congregated on the terrace outside Jamie s in the rain and as there was no specific smoking area or any ashtrays the floor became littered with cigarette buts ,0
 A bit of noise from a nearby restaurant meaning sleeping with windows close Wifi needed persistion to connect,0
 Only one English TV channel but honestly why are you watching TV in Paris ,0
 Breakfast dinner very basic and repetitive ,0
 Set up of the floor and how to get there is a bit difficult Lifts dont go to all rooms Although we were very late arrivals I asked them to set out the room keys in alphabetical order with the welcome drinks at the dinner venue but this was not done When I arrived all the room keys were handed to me and it was chaos in the small foyer with the luggage and 33 people and me trying to give room keys to people Otherwise it was ok Gracias ,0
 No bath,0
 18 50 for breakfast wasn t aware of having to give 150euros for security deposit on check in,0
 The breakfast is good but too expensive ,0
 Poor water pressure and barely warm shower,0
 Stylish yet slightly akward with storage space,0
 Dusty bedroom furniture,0
 Room was cold aircon not working and small bed uncomfortable pool was cold loud awful music playing in restaurant foyer and mezzanine area,0
 None,0
 Found the charging system a little confusing ie prepayment of one night s accommodation plus 60 not sure why this was necessary,0
 heater on all time due to age of building and room bit small for three adults in suite,0
 Food from room service,0
 Our room smelt kind of damp I guess this was because of the poor ventilation in the bathroom ,0
 Room designed for 1 double bed had been reconfigured with 2 large double beds that made the desk unusable and no place to sit except on a bed Elevator was being repaired ,0
 rooms has no mini fridge,0
 Construction going on ,0
 Only 2 pillows on bed asked for more but they didn t arrive also when I left my pass in the room and got another one which I then left in the room the chap on the desk didn t tell me that the original wouldn t work so had to get another one ,0
 No air con og a window that opens enough to let in fresh air,0
 There was damage to our bathroom door when we arrived but the staff resolved this issue very quickly,0
 Small lobby room view,0
 The bath was too small and deep The mini bar and snacks were very very expensive The dinner menu was to fancy so we ate out We like traditional food ,0
 Quite packed when we were there and somewhat bling Too many guest tattoos ,0
 the windows in our room were very odd it only started from 1 5m up so we basically did not have a view ,0
 Only two of the three lifts were working meaning delay The breakfast choice in their executive lounge was limited to scrambled eggs only Disappointing ,0
 Some fundamental design flaw about the toilet the door cannot be closed properly The whole room stinks all the time The hotel floors have some kind of weird sourish smell ,0
 Our room was kinda broken up into 3 parts and the bed was small a small double,0
 No charge for lounges by the pool,0
 We felt breakfast was overpriced and would have liked to have had breakfast at the hotel,0
 Bed was very hard and the room air conditioning system was not anyway efficient The,0
 Hotel lacks outdoor space and it was very sunny whilst we were there Food choices were limited ,0
 Too noisy at night no wonder they provide complimentary ear plugs Beds not comfortable ,0
 Poor quality room television ,0
 Everything was good,0
 The porker face staff and the old facilities ,0
 The rooms are worst I have ever seen Very small and uncomfortable The boss need to think about staff because staff need to solve that problem but they can t solve it It s not their fault but they try to do best to make guest happy ,0
 Sometimes we felt too removed from the city We got inaccurate directions twice from two different staff members They were certainly kind and helpful but if they didn t know where they were going they should find someone who does ,0
 The staff were very friendly except for the nightshift guy who politely kicked us out of the hotel until our check in time of 2 PM One of our friends was very sick and we needed to rest from the 8 hour bus ride and he said it wasn t permitted to stay in the lobby which was very unfortunate as we only needed to catch a breath ,0
 Needed redecorating I liked the style just needed a sproose up,0
 Not a lot of natural light in the room a bit gloomy Many different switches for many different lights in the room a bit hard irritating to figure out how to turn them off A few small eateries within walking distance to the hotel but not a very lively area overall Two bottles of water in the room but only upon arrival and not replenished Because it s an old hotel the way from the reception to the room is a labyrinth be on your toes Found it expensive for what it was 17 pounds for breakfast seemed a bit high ,0
 Only 1 sachet of hot chocolate between 2 ,0
 I booked 2 bed apartment which is in different location around 100 meter from the hotel old furniture not clean the apartment full of Ants in the beds bathrooms in the kitchen and simple thing not available like a pen or notes the hotel management very poor in the customer service careless not recommended ,0
 the shoe i bought in paris ,0
 Facilities may need to be upgraded ,0
 The shower door didn t close properly and leaked water all over the floor,0
 Windows that open as it s very hard to get the temperature right with air con ,0
 The room was small but functional ,0
 Bathroom amenities,0
 Our room was as a non smoking room however it heavily smelt of stale smoke and there was an ash tray and matches in the room The room wasn t available until approx 3 30pm and we arrived at 2 30ish Duvet was similar to a thick sheet and not warm enough,0
 Overall experience wasn t that great The rooms and beds were relatively small Too hot in the room the lowest was 20 degrees you could get down to which for me wasn t enough The views from the rooms were horrible also Loads of construction sites around Neighbourhood definitely the worst I ve seen in Barcelona Old bath robes made of Teddy bear material ,0
 Dusty curtains on upper parts Few places to hang clothes towels and bathrobes in the bathroom ,0
 Small rooms,0
 The neighborhood was a bit sketchy,0
 More choices of food on the menu had no idea what most of the food was part of the shower was broken but the shower overall worked just fine so I wasn t too fussed,0
 Day staff were fantastic however night staff were horrendous we booked a second night and they could only offer us a double and two singles we had booked two doubles and they couldn t understand why I might want to actually share a room with my husband It took 3 hours to sort out and in the end we were put in a taxi and taken to a different hotel who were very rude and unhelpful also a Radisson It was very frustrating to constantly be told that the new hotel was doing us a favour Extremely poor customer service We were hoping to end our weekend with a few drinks in the bar however it was 1 45am by the time we were actually checked in We wished we had found somewhere on our own but it was too late ,0
 The hotel is in a great location On arrival at the hotel we were given the opportunity to upgrade to an Executive Room for an extra 15 per night which we did but couldn t really find anything Executive about it and the pillows were absolutely awful ,0
 Price of breakfast was a little steep ,0
 The Apple tv didn t work but the cost was refunded after explaining to staff about it ,0
 Bed takes up whole width of room Attempt to be cool didn t quite work No bath ,0
 It would have been nice to be able to make a cup of tea in our room ,0
 hard pillows,0
 Would have liked a bar,0
 The shower ,0
 The bathroom area was very cramped and being an old building you did hear other guests moving around in their room above,0
 Someone at the check in desk gave us the wrong time for the shuttle bus we were almost late and would have missed our flight,0
 We were dissapointed by the spa only steam bath and no sauna at all It was also separated between men and women so not very good experience if you are in couple My main dissatisfaction concerns the front desk I forgot my credit card and even if the room was payed in advance they refused to accept us in the room if we don t leave 100 per night as deposit I know by heart the number of my credit card the security code and had my phone for the 3D security connection the room was payed with the same card on my name and I had ID with me but they insist that I should show the plastic Finally I was accepted with only 100 deposit but if I didn t have friends in London to borrow some money it could be a very poor weekend Of course it was my fault to forget my card but if I know everything by heart it could be treated as an Internet purchase and anyway treated in more friendly way ,0
 The only let down in our entire stay was with the breakfast service It was disorganised and every morning we were missing a number of things from the table such as cups spoons forks we d to call the waitress numerous times We always like to have some fruit withe our hot breakfast and when ordered everything came together which made the table very full and uncomfortable The breakfast was great when it came ,0
 room was not cleaned till 21 00,0
 Bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off There could be possibility to go to the balcony,0
 Staff very rude,0
 Air con was ineffective so it was pretty warm in the room Wifi only in the lobby ,0
 The fact that we could only stay for one night ,0
 horrible service They don t pick up your laundry and the front desk at night does not speak english Rude reception ,0
 Cost,0
 Small stuffy room Could hear either hot water or heating running all time room dimly lit and light outside toilet was on timer sensor and kept switching off Bathroom small could not believe in 2015 having paid for room and breakfast they want GBP10 00 for WIFI This should be normal to be included these days Water from cold tap was warm so obviously running too close to hot pipe not nice to clean teeth in warm water or grab glass to drink in the night ,0
 The bar staff were not overly friendly or helpful,0
 Breakfast was poor cold not all items available though they didn t charge for it after complaint,0
 No complaints,0
 Small room,0
 The location is hidden and moisy from the nearer area I had to stay minimum 30 min In a queue to ask the staff a question The staff are not helpful and give wrong info about the city ,0
 The fragrance machine in the room was Very weak and we couldnt really smell anything ,0
 No Bill boy or Toillet hose,0
 I would do with some mini bar selection but that was a minor setback ,0
 Distance,0

 The price is very high reflecting the location ,0
 Personal could have been more friendly ,0
 The room is extremely small TV and the bathroom were broken in the first room We were offered to change the room A free meal was granted as a compensation but a quick look at sent us immediately to the nearest fish restaurant The price is too high for this accommodation ,0
 No room service after 10pm Check out slow ,0
 Couple of teething problems with the airconditioning and ipad,0
 Reception furniture looks great but is not comfortable,0
 A bit old and shaby but ok for couple of nights,0
 AS IN YOUR HOME YOU WILL FIND NO GYM NO POOL SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT NOT AMAZING WHICH YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A VERY SMALL HOTEL SUCH AS THIS ,0
 food options in the restaurant is ok could be better additionally having to go down and get my food at the restaurant is inconvenient ,0
 Booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price,0
 No plastic bags for the bins livingroom kitchen and bathroom which I think it s essential particularly when you have a kitchenette inside your studio because at some point if you cook or eat something you will need a rubbish bin to dispose your leftovers A part from that everything was perfect ,0
 Only downfall upon visiting the hotel room there was no soap or shower gel present but upon visiting the reception they handed some over to use ,0
 Housekeeping service left much room for improvement ,0
 Poor internet,0
 room wifi is not free of charge which is not shown on booking com before you place the order The receptionist talked to the manager and exempted the charge ,0
 only thing missing is a gym weird thing everything in the fridge is complimentary means two small water bottles LOL,0
 The swimming pool was really really tiny They should do something about it May be expand a little bit more,0
 Bath water a little tepid,0

 Room was not made up one day We had to request this late in the afternoon Room was very warm Difficult to get a comfortable temperature Shower screen door leaked badly ,0
 Breakfast wasn t anything different to any other hotel Was expecting service rather than a buffet ,0
 Lifeless bar and better use could be made of the views Queue for breakfast,0
 the wifi was very bad in our room barely connected,0
 More Paddington area than Marble Arch but not too far away ,0
 Room a bit small but well equpped and comfortable Fire alarm going off in the morning ,0
 Floor 10 noise from sky bar dont stay on 10th floor,0

 Overcharged for drinks,0
 Free WiFi is terrible There was a long line to check out this process should be a lot faster ,0
 The cost of the snack basket in the room,0
 I had a single room on the basement level The room was simply TOO small There was only about 1 meter on either side of the bed and very cramped though bed was comfortable The bathroom was also modern but extremely small There was no breakfast possible in the hotel This should thus be a 3 star hotel ,0
 There wasn t really a bar ,0
 Wifi connection was a bit slow in my room,0
 Sky bar closed until 5 30pm open at lunchtime please,0
 All was good,0
 parking issues only,0

 quite far from all attractions places,0
 Dissapointing brekfast for a 4 star hotel Not much choice for hot drink Coffee was not very good Staff at check in was very rude We did not feel welcomed His behaviour was unacceptable Checking out was with a lady was fine,0
 Rooms were small Our room was not clean when we arrived The staff were disorganized and not always helpful ,0
 Location facilities,0
 Although the service and facilities are worth it I wish it were a little less expensive as i d stay there more often for now it will have to remain a rare treat ,0
 Needs much better wifi in every room,0
 Selfish smokers on level 8 ,0
 Rooms smelt like smoke and I could hear EVERY WORD our neighbours spoke probably through the vents It was quite noisy Not in very good repair Mattresses are very hard ,0
 Very small room and the bed was not comfortable ,0
 As a lone female traveller I found that the Raval area at night had some unsavoury characters which made me look over my shoulders a little but in the daytime I was ok and just tried to be as streetwise as possible The Hospital gardens and Boqueria Market were conveniently within 5 10 minutes walk and the port was about 15 minutes walk which was useful as I made use of one of the boat tours which ran from 12 15pm as I was there out of season ,0
 Menu is too limited,0
 The airconditioning system was functioning intermittently the temperature inside the room feels hotter than what we had set it for ,0
 The barman in sky bar wasn t that friendly a little abrupt ,0
 Bed was uncomfortable and small,0
 Loads of corridors and stairs to my room that I had no staff help me carry my bags Single female with 30 kgs of luggage was difficult up front stairs and up 2 stair cases to my room Not sure why they put me in a room which was up stairs ,0
 1 Rudeness from one of the staff when I was doing the check in I was discussing a wrong transaction done by the hotel and he replied I don t have time for that Go contact booking com I did then booking com representative confirmed that they made a mistake and they solved the issue For me this employee is rude and don t know how to deal with a customer 2 Mostly they don t answer the room service or front desk calls ,0
 On this occasion I didn t like the room I stayed in basement junior suite room 3 as the chair table didn t work height wise so I couldn t sit work chair was way too low there was no mobile phone reception the TV was left of the bed so you neither watch to from the bed or armchairs comfortably It is a double bedroom not a suite Please don t be put off though as generally the other rooms are great staff are welcoming ,0
 King helton executive room it dosent look like that its a king executive ,0
 the room was a bit small especially our triple room for 3 of us Some of the staff were more helpful then others when it came to knowledge about the area restaurants etc ,0
 Doesn t deserve 4 stars Cleaning staff from early morning ocupying stairs and elevator Breakfast not very good ,0
 Very noisy room small room bar closed,0
 Difficult to park downstairs as narrow spaces and strange angles Had a run in with a pole ,0
 Breakfast included would have been a nice touch,0
 The pictures don t represent the reality of the hotel it is very disappointing,0
 Room was way too small Photos very deceiving Had to put our second luggage on top of wardrobe and bring it up and down each time we needed it Less than 2 feet passage way between bed and hanging tv on wall No space for two people to move around in room One of us had to stay all the time on the bed This made our stay in the room very uncomfortable and frustrating Very very small room ,0
 A bit hard to find using the address given Entrance is from a different street opposite the tube station The breakfast is not vegetarian friendly at all But at least for me they gave a nice salad when I requested ,0
 Room was a bit small but this is London they are all small ,0
 Tv is small Canbe little noisy,0
 Shower made for short people Couldn t stand underneath it without having to bend down to wash my hair ,0
 A little pricey but I m sure that is to be expected for the area ,0
 We stayed in the room with bunkbeds but kids were scared to use the top bed because the ladder were not fixed to beds and we re moving ,0
 Overall my experience was very good ,0
 Lights in room were not at all ambient and either dark or far too bright Minor point really,0
 No swimming pool ,0
 slow wifi not working all the time ,0
 More sockets in the rooms ,0
 Only complaint is that there was no plug point for kettle but not a problem just moved it to bedside to use Breakfast was ok but adequate ,0
 Gffd,0
 Bathroom glass door broken no windows in the room,0
 Hit a cold snap snow showers Heating not working in bathroom and radiator switched off not working House keeping supplied another heater to try to help Engineers called to repair ,0
 Air conditioning inadequate,0
 The bed was not comfortable two very hard twin sized beds pushed together The small vanity area lacked sufficient lighting for putting on makeup etc the open floor plan and black tile dark furnishings made the room very dark ,0
 Very busy impersonal hotel ,0
 We were placed on the 8 floor one room from the lift shaft The whole nite we had the lift dynamo run and keept us awake Not happy at all Also location is really out of the way And the area is not nice Thanks god it was for one nite only ,0
 None,0
 I never got a response to my online requests about my ability to check in prior to the 2 pm time slot Once I got to the hotel I was told I was unable to check in early and ended up waiting six hours whereas I could have planned accordingly had my requests been responded to ,0
 no slippers or I didn t find them ,0
 We didn t like the setup of the rooms The bathrooms are very close to bed and if you are a couple it could be a little inconvenient ,0
 Poor view and hair grips left in our room,0
 Sofa bed for third person was ancient and could feel the springs through the thin mattress My son managed to sleep on it but I would not have ,0
 Rude unhelpful night staff Terrible room smelt of urine and was like someone s attic No gym and fitness facilities Go to the one in canary wharf it s so much better Room service don t bother answering calls ,0
 No ironing possibility long walk to room missing signage to navigate the ongoing renovation,0
 The receptionist was not very friendly with straight face most of the time ,0

 The Euro18 breakfast was way too expensive ,0
 Not enough lighting in room just lamps,0
 The only thing missing in the room was the laundry rail in the shower and also ventilation in the shower ,0
 A lot of everyday staff cannot speak English chambermaids etc ,0
 should include breakfast for the price ,0
 The room with two twin beds would have been too small We would not have enjoyed our stay as long as we did ,0
 The staff where really bad And I was late to check out the ring the police for me strange when it says they charge 10 a hour extra but I was 28 mins late they ring the police,0
 Based on the cost of the room I was not impressed that a bottle of water was not complimentary ,0
 Too small room to move Elevator so small I used the steps ,0
 Wish there was a pool ,0
 When it was time to check out down at the reception the staff there tried to impose a bill on me that wasn t mine They accused me of taking a bottle of beer even when I don t drink they even went further to say there was an empty bottle of beer right on my fridge That was a big lie,0
 Breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy A few items were unavailable on Sunday due to shortages The breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable ,0
 It was all fine,0
 My room on the ground floor at the back 03 seemed to be a little cold for sitting in the room even though I played with the wall heat controller However the room temperature was fine for sleeping ,0
 My room was at the end of a maze long distance from the elevators it seemed to be a separate building that has been linked together later ,0
 Having to ask for a pot of tea for breakfast and toast as staff kept walking past us ,0
 There are not enough tables and chairs for those eating breakfast Families were having to sit separately and people were having to move half way through their breakfast to be seated together Need more tables ,0
 Tiny room and our room had major issue with the toilet flush Also ventilation was not good and fogged heavily after showers Good breakfast but at times there were long waiting queues due to tour groups leading us to skip the breakfast ,0
 It was unfortunate that i was there while renovation was going on is some rooms it was during the day mainly but management handled that and were apologetic I will definitely come back ,0
 I thought the use of the gym and pool was included in the price but it wasn t you had to pay extra ,0
 The price of the room should of included breakfast ,0
 The power went out in parts of the hotel and it closed the kitchen When we returned from sight seeing we were unable to get dinner ,0
 Wifi was limited which was surprising disappointing for business orientated hotel,0
 Hotel needs a revamp the reception area is not in keeping with a 4 star hotel the paint is marked The staff on reception were rude and unhelpful,0
 Price doubled at weekend,0
 Cleanliness of facilities,0
 n a,0
 Room stank of cigarette smoke Money was taken out of my account without my permission after I had paid full bill This left me with no money to take my disabled daughter anywhere This ruined our first Hilton experience I still have not received my money back Am furious and disgusted ,0
 Bar was not open where the swimming pool is when we were there,0
 Breakfast not included,0
 We were not advised that the hotel had no license to sell alcohol We weren t able to use the restaurant for our planned celebration with friends we ate elsewhere ,0

 Breakfast can be included ,0
 The bathroom unpleasant smell I m assuming it s an old building,0
 Room was a little cramped for 2 people and luggage,0
 The bar was pricy but it s quite usual in every hotel ,0
 Holiday inn not providing porter service to rooms especially when there are stairs to climb after getting out of the elevator Providing drinking water bottles only for 1 night out of the 6 nights we stayed No gym,0
 Standard rooms face interior light well and windows don t open so a bit confining but not bad ,0
 Very small bathroom no bath ,0
 Breakfast could be richer,0
 Be warned that the bathrooms have no door for the tub For a couple it was fine but for families or friends it s not ideal if you are modest ,0
 Expensive bar dtinks,0
 far from City Center noisy not really a 4 star Hotel,0
 Lack of wifi things not being practical and not being right from the start ,0
 No milk in room,0
 It was a shame the hotel didn t have a restaurant for the evenings but staff recommended two within the square both of which were really good friendly staff great surroundings and excellent food ,0
 Breakfast could be more generous ,0
 Although a very nice touch a welcome cookie For those of us who have a nut allergy and in this day and age plenty people do It would be nice to offer something without a nut content,0
 Despite a luxurious bathroom the hotwater system wasn t brilliant and our shower and bath water was never hot only warm to slightly warmer ,0
 The room is not as big as it looks in the pictures ,0
 Too ultramodern and dark atmosphere,0
 Breakfast very very expensive for what it was service charged added but service not great ,0
 Breakfast was very French too rich for American taste ,0
 The only problem is the parking Garage available but very expensive ,0
 Provided with map from hotel to find car park we drive around for 2 hours looking for it it s completely out of sight under shopping Center and no signs in the end we paid a taxi driver 10 to show us advice better map better instructions,0
 Went down to the pool to relax However since it is a small area and lots of kids it was very loud and frustrating I understand this is out of your hands so maybe implementing a kids hour or two would make the pool area a little more peaceful ,0
 Room was very small We booked a superior room It had a sloping roof in the shower which meant you could only stand at one side The wash hand basin was part of the wardrobe furniture and was in the bedroom area which we did not like This should be in the bathroom area ,0
 Meal where not good value for money,0
 The breakfast price,0
 the mattresses weren t comfortable at all very old and used The electricity wasn t compatible with our mobiles we couldn t charge neither them or the PCs the bath bagno was blocked and the water remained until the 2nd day ,0

 The bed was uncomfortable ,0
 The only problem we had was poor wifi reception ,0
 No WiFi connection in the room the lavatory wasn t well heated,0
 The room could be bigger for a 4 stars hotel The restaurant for dinner is too expensive 10 Euros for one soup ,0
 Water is the washing sink goes down very slowly And the washing sink itself in near the bed may wake up other person at night ,0
 Beds were very hard excellent quality but too hard Long walk to center but doable if you like to walk ,0
 Bread was mouldy at breakfast Room menu out of date,0
 N a,0
 Room smelled a bit of cigarettes ,0
 Bar at lobby could be more luxury Cheap glasses for scotch and dirt look tables doesn t help much,0
 check out took too long just one person behind the desk with a queue of 5 guests while 3 concierge chating also behind the desk pillows were poor and bathrobes large towels should be expected in a 4 star hotel,0
 Lift a bit narrow,0
 I did not like that we had to buy our coffee and tea for the room A couple of tea and coffee sachets put daily would not have cost a lot yet would have added a lot of value to one s stay ,0
 No spoons in the room and the fridge was too cold and froze my fruit salad ,0
 Our Breakfast was always missing something fork milk etc and could be a bit more generous with the bread croissants etc Hotel could do with a bit of a makeover ,0
 The toilet window why an internal window whatever happened to privacy ,0
 terrible restaurant ,0
 Carpet stained with blood drops flagged to reception but obviously ignored by housekeeping Reception immediately offered another room Despite Booking com stating 1 room safe 2 pay per view channels neither were available ,0
 Parking charges,0
 room view,0
 The whole property feels and looks dated ,0
 Reception is always very busy Breakfast is not so good considering the price ,0
 Staff,0
 the bed was too soft for my ailing back I would also have like a more comfortable chair to watch TV but the room was rather small ,0
 The check in process was terrible We arrived at approximately 3 30 check in after 2pm is listed on the confirmation form and were told that we had to wait more than 1 2 hour before our room would be ready Also I would not consider this to be a 4 star hotel Perhaps 3 Finally the website indicates that Grange Buckingham serves breakfast daily for all its hotel residents in the breakfast room on the Ground Floor You can choose from a variety of breakfast items including both continental and cooked breakfast selections I assumed that the breakfast was included in the price of the room as no extra costs are mentioned Terrible to misinform potential guests ,0
 Hotel Very busy Reception not helpful ,0
 Shoddy presentation with scuffed furniture and marks on the carpet Strange deep half sized bath for the shower and bathroom taps that are marked Sleep disturbed by the metro under the hotel and other mechanical noise from 4 15 am ,0
 Location far from metro I thout that my booking enclud breakfast but wasnt I have to pay mor than 110 for breakfasts only ,0
 Room was a bit stuffy,0
 Outlook view ,0
 Looked better on the pictures very expensive for what you get ,0
 There were no slippers in the room and the walls are not sound proof,0
 It was horrible Hopefully the next stay will be better since there is a no cancellation policy Horrible hotel,0
 Not many good shops or restaurants nearby ,0
 Worndown and rather unclean hotell Not up to todays standard on hotells ,0
 One or two of the rooms need new matresses on the bed ,0
 Rooms located on the 1st floor were a bit noisy disturbing sleep Moved to 4th floor on second night and had a great sleep Although food was good the Food menu at evening could do with having more choice ,0
 Extremely small room no room to put anything on a bedside table Tiny desk But the bed made up for this ,0
 Checking in was self service so not personal ,0
 It could do with a refurb but it did a job for me as I was just looking for a bed for the night but would have been disappointed if I have stayed there with my wife,0
 Poor quality bread,0
 The staff could have better english They were hard to understand sometimes ,0
 Bad sound insulation from the corridor,0
 The wifi did not work in the room which was in 5th floor But was working very well in the lounge ,0
 Everything was really good ,0
 We had breakfast in hotel one morning and it was over priced at 18 each and not much selection quite poor for a hotel this good and let s itself down Only negative thing to say though ,0
 The breakfast was very poor There were only croissants coffee cheese ham cornflakes bread and yogurt If you want to eat something hot it has scrupled or fried eggs and pancakes it was included in the breakfast but you had to order it and wait at list 10 15 min This waiting time was with no other people in the breakfast room imagine a busy day ,0
 waiting time at the elevator,0
 size of the room,0
 The room was so sad with a horrible and dirty looking wall to wall carpet and the best days of the furniture were long gone ,0
 No faults,0
 Pillow is hard like a rubber ball ,0
 Awfull internet poor view from the window a little bit far from city center,0
 The room was dirty and in dire need of updaating The bed and linens were so uncomfortable we barely got any sleep This was our last night in Paris and we were unable to find a room anywhere else that was 3 stars due to Fashion Week Now I know why this one was available ,0
 Drinks and food to exspensive,0
 The size of room was very tiny even u could t put your Luggage The value of money vs comfort is bloody poor ,0
 Nauseating smell of paint They were painting while we were there and it made me sick No face towels no ironing board in room Terrible coffee Shower drain full of hair Tub didn t drain,0
 No negatives ,0
 Don t bother paying extra for a club room the club lounge needs updating and is a bit stuffy we decided to have breakfast in the main area and weren t disappointed We couldn t get in our room until just after 15 00 hrs this is stated when booking but as a rule you can check in earlier st other hotels,0
 surprising that such a hotel did not offer free wifi or for that matter two robes instead of one The staff at the Booking Office bar was a bit unpleasant and non accommodating,0
 WiFi lowered in the hotel,0
 We had a leaky kettle but I m sure if we d have asked it would have been replaced No other problems at all from check in to check out perfect in every way for us ,0
 Do yourselves a favour Sort out the internal way finding signs It s a labyrinth but that s not the issue Your lazy approach in respect of making sure guests know how to find the way to their very expensive rooms is a complete joke There are plenty of sign companies in London Hire one of them ,0
 tiny room with old decoration some distance away from the train station,0
 The bed could have been bigger and a better newer matrass ,0
 You have to pay nearly 10eur for a wifi that doesn t work properly I forgot my toothbrush and the hotel had none to spare for me It s a good hotel but certainly not a 5 stars ,0
 No bathrobe ,0
 The room booklet and the notices downstairs all advertise afternoon tea in the lobby and yet we never saw it happen and the staff were completely unaware of it when asked You can hear footsteps from upstairs rooms quite loudly in the room ,0
 Quite far inside ,0
 Internet was a serious dissapointment ,0
 There was no bar or alcoholic drinks available during our stay The licence had not been renewed Free internet was very slow Work going on at the hotel ,0
 The glass panel for the shower too small and easy to make the bathroom wet ,0
 Unable to access games room as it was being used for a conference during our stay ,0
 Room size quite small Bathroom in the middle of the room Uncomfortable Bathroom,0
 A big hotel and you feld that The staff was polite But we missed a bit of the personal touch of the staff they didn t look very pleased with there job ,0
 The a c was hard to figure out I don think I ever got it right ,0
 Several front desk staff were not very warm Room service did not provide clean glasses throughout our 5 day stay just when we arrived Only refreshed bottled water once Mould in shower ,0
 Noise traveled between rooms I could hear people in the next room ,0
 Room was small for a Queen Size and the windows where really in need of replacement Heating in room was loud if turned on and 20 for breakfast is excessive wouldn t go again unless seriously discounted,0
 Everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach ,0
 Repair the bathroom window as a terrible draught comes in no handle to secure the window from draughts Surprised only 1 radiator in the bathroom and none in the bedroom ,0
 was triple room but was smaller than the advertised pictures on the net,0
 My bed wasn t really super comfortable Although I had asked for a quiet room there was just outside my window a football field and I could hear not only people talking but also the ball hitting the grid ,0
 The now you see it now you don t glass wall to the bathroom took some getting used to ,0
 I had problems with noise from the street and light coming up from the jammed curtain ,0
 Would have preferred a cheaper price but still good value for money,0
 No alcoholic drinks sold at the bar and poor cleaning in rooms,0
 Hot weekend and air conditioning poor front window opened out to the so noise until early hours,0
 10 floors only 2 Elevators Pluming problems with some rooms bathtubs Parking lot is 5 minutes give or take from the hotel ,0
 This hotel is not Savoy This hotel is emb hotel They should change hotel name ,0
 The room was quite far from the elevator ,0
 We booked a twin superior room and got a double with a camp bed in The room on the ground floor was above the underground so we heard every train go through We did not request a ground floor room Real shame,0
 Be careful with rooms to rear Street is cobbled and bins dragged up and down from early morning 5 30am This is s budget hotel and not a business hotel In fact sign at entrance says Pension Domizil ,0
 Not the comfiest bed and we do like a nice duvet It got a little warm overnight and the heating air con blower was a little load Shut it off and opened the window The garden view from the first floor was actually of a flat roof but the church the other side was nice ,0
 Could do with big mirror and weetabix for breakfast ,0
 I won t get the upgrade next time The staff in the man bar where hard work to order to serve to pay the bill you had to chase them up every time,0
 The pressure to pay for an upgrade to our room by subtly suggesting our room wasn t that good ,0
 This hotel exceeded our expectations in every way would not hesitate to recommend it to friends ,0
 Requested a dockside view when searching for hotel and crown plaza came up with a price on arrival advised needed to pay additional 60 for 2 nights with a view Misleading A poor start to our trip ,0
 false sauna pool info on description page No breakfast inclulded They have only COLD WATER jacuzzi ,0
 Everything was perfect ,0
 Breakfast is expensive There are supermarkets and restaurants near the hotel You can have breakfast outside Baby bed is not comfartable We asked for extra blanket to put under the baby ,0
 Room Service Knocks the Door even though don t not disturb sign was there this disturbed my Sleep,0
 The roads in Paris are really confusing the hotel was fab though and the metro was easy and very close ,0
 The sunday morning the wake up called did not worked The breakfast was open kind of late ,0
 The carpet in the bedroom isn t appropriate for allergic people A parquet would be better Suite good breakfast but disappointing scrambled eggs and bacon Bad orange juiice The pain au chocolat was excellent ,0
 Parking was 30 for 24hrs we were told it was 24 but got charged more despite being in car park for less than 24hrs Breakfast 15 50 and not that great buffet style No draught lagers beers,0
 Warm environment on cold days,0
 I felt that the buffet breakfast although very good was not the same as ordering a freshly made meal ,0
 No tea or coffee making facilities in room Air conditioning made air skin dry and woke up feeling very dry ,0
 Room was very stuffy and warm Air conditioning was poor ,0
 Staff attitude Phones not working Cold dirty water in the showers ,0
 The outside of the hotel looks really out dated but don t let that put you off ,0
 Size of room and bathroom extremely small ,0
 Room was rather warm could not open windows and air con seemed to have no effect ,0
 Was told taxi booked at hotel was a fixed price to airport Taxi driver asked for more but as I just had exact amount he waived extra The toiletries were rather small sized for 2 people In order to use the swimming pool we were told we would have to go down in robe For that reason we did not use the facility The lighting in bathroom could have been better devised ,0
 All was good,0
 Our standard double room was really small just about wide enough to fit the bed It was ok for 2 nights and we were out for most of the day but it wouldn t have been comfortable for a longer stay ,0
 The room was absolutely freezing cold,0
 Washbasin a little tiny but The shower is quite large so not a r al issue ,0
 Beds too hard Charged 20 for a open tab facility that i didn t use or need,0
 Was a shame that the roof top terrace and pool wasn t open Wasn t aware of this when booking Was hot enough to have had a drink up on the terrace,0
 Poor Breakfast,0
 not so much spacious,0
 The free data phone didn t have any spare power charger and was useless during our entire stay the staff could have made an extra effort to at least get a spare as it is a standard samsung phone only ,0
 Many things don t work ,0
 Reception did not could not call taxis,0
 The room is old and ugly the ceiling in the bathroom is kind of disgusting The bed seemed to be broken on the left side it made a loud noise every time my husband got out of the bed The accommodation is definitely not the level of a four star hotel Last year I stayed at Novotel in Berlin which is by far nicer cleaner and more beautiful This hotel was quite disappointing ,0
 We would recommend to install new windows to reduce the surrounding noise ,0
 On arrival we had a meal in the lounge bar also coffees The coffee was only just warm and service was quite slow I do believe the young male bartender was possibly new to the job When the meal arrived at our table we then had to wait several minutes for cutlery to be given to us All being said the meal was excellent couldn t be faulted ,0
 The room was dirty on arrival and I had to ask to have it cleaned The breakfast was poor ,0
 Dirty carpet no breakfast included no fridge,0
 I had to leave ,0
 Most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in ,0
 L argent room,0
 No water at room noisy from street,0
 We were left waiting for a while after asking if we could get a glass of wine in return from a day out I would expect to be able to get a drink at a 5 hotel but small issue,0
 The room was tiny and not represented as such on the photos on the website Barely any decoration in the main bedroom no curtains a plain blind pictures or decorative elements other than simple cushions ,0
 Breakfast cost too high,0
 far from train station free transfer to train not for coming back consider to come again,0
 Stuff is not friendly,0
 Bath towels could have been bigger ,0
 Bed size room size were tiny ,0
 Flachsp ler shallow flush toilet Small bathroom ,0
 Too many pillows,0
 The weather but the hotel couldnt do anything about that ,0
 went for breakfast at 8 30 The milk orange juice plates and bowls had all run out They were replaced very quickly but one lady was very unhappy Would have helped if a member of staff had kept an eye on the situation ,0
 The room we were booked in 325 smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke We asked for another one and were given a new room without any problems but I wonder why a family our son is eight was booked into a smoking room in the first place ,0
 The wifi broke down on our first day of arrival which was extremely inconvenient as we struggled to find a store that sold SIM card on a Sunday We asked the receptionist and she said it was because the hotel was fully booked It was not an acceptable excuse and we had to use the paper map to plan tomorrow s trip without a way to communicate with our family and friends Nevertheless it was already fixed on the next day The bed on the other hand was not the cleanest one I found dusts on my blanket so it was not very confortable For the location although there were quite a number of shops on the street right before you make a turn towards the hotel it was 10 minutes away from the Wien Westhbf ,0
 The shower head kept falling down when trying to shower ,0
 A wake up alarm that was inbuilt in the room and which I had not set or touched at all went off at 1am which totally ruined my entire nights sleep and the following day This was completely avoidable The hotel should ensure that this doesn t happen I complained to the duty manager and all she suggested was an upgrade next time and a complimentary breakfast next time which would not be sufficient to persuade me to return added to that when I turned the shower on I and the bathroom were quite fiercely and unexpectedly soaked as the cleaner had left one of the shower heads facing out The main thing guests want when staying away is a good nights sleep and value for money This hotel failed to get the basics right ,0
 The swimming pool on the roof is quite small Not the best isolated rooms depending on your neighbors you can hear all their conversations ,0
 too many light switches took us a while to figure out uow to turn the lights off,0
 The young lady who served us at the spa was extremely rude and the bar food was disappointing,0
 There was no air conditioning in the room badly dont l ke th s hotel but amazing location,0
 Breakfast very expensive,0
 On having a shower we discovered that the drain was blocked It took only 30 seconds or so for the water to start spilling into the bathroom It took 3 calls to reception before the drain was unblocked on our 2nd night a 5 minute job The king size bed was made of two separately made single beds butted up together with a gap in the middle The free internet had to reactivated after each 24 hour period The reactivation process was complicated and took too much time ,0
 Breakfast poor,0
 Provide direction signs in car i e entrance and exit,0
 In our double room the bed was composed of two single beds put together So that was less convenient ,0
 I didn t like that there is no wifi in the rooms as you have to pay for it The hotel itself is expensive but when not busy you can get a bargain but it s not that often ,0
 lifts and bathrooms were too small for such a grand venue ,0
 Food by the pool was really awful and we had a very long wait to check in but not sure how you could improve that maybe just bad timing ,0
 The room was stuffy and I could not get the thermostat and air conditioning to work properly Had to open the terrace door to circulate the air ,0
 Poor Wifi,0
 Dirty dusty window ledge in room with the remains of the previous guest snacks on it the disorganised coffee situation in the morning ,0
 Despite the chosen policy Pay after your stay the hotel has demanded the payment during check in It s not very nice since this option costs extra money nevertheless ,0
 No tea and coffee making facility in room ,0
 We were on the 2nd floor and were woken up at 8am by workmen constantly hammering in the first floor room I phoned reception and was offered a complimentary breakfast Very nice but would have preferred a lie in on our holiday No bacon or any pork products for breakfast and the hotel does not serve alcohol it s owned by a Muslim who adheres to Sharia law Didn t bother us veggie breakfast was good but if this is something you want don t book here ,0
 So many guests and only two staff on te reception desk Almost always you have to wait in the queue 15 00 check in time was very uncomfortable If your flight arrives in the morning you have to wait for a long time The room was clean but the floor was a bit dusty,0
 The bathrooms are a bit strange The whole room is like a blown up larger version of a Japanese capsule hotel and the bathroom seems as if you are in a strange tube for shower and toilet ,0
 The air conditioner at one room was not efficient enough in a hot sunny day The lobby as well as the hallways were not air conditioned The towels smelled weird even after getting new ones The housekeeping needs some improvements ,0
 The tv didn t work and the room was very cold,0
 Had some parking difficulties Finally i used the Park and Ride further down the street ,0
 Wasn t told there would be noisy building work going on Was offered an alternative room but one overlooking railway and one closer to the building work Would not have booked had I know there would be building work as here for an anniversary Room is also internal so very dark Room was hot and the air conditioning was very loud and inadequate Bed was very uncomfortable and only three thin pillows for two people bed runner was stained Overall disappointing stay and would not recommend Hotel looks lovely in the lobby but the carpet in the hall way and bedrooms faded and the the rooms look tired ,0
 Poor TV reception If only it matched the warmth of the staff ,0
 There is a night club in the hotel basement and we could hear the music all through the night in our room which was on the mezzanine floor It wasn t very loud but audible nevertheless ,0
 ice cold rooms unclear shady communication smelly sheets cigarette smell all over the place even in our room ,0
 No dislikes,0
 Cheaper bar prices won t happen ,0
 Facilities,0
 Kettle in room they do want you to join in downstairs but occasionally it is nice to just chill with a tea in your room You can take a tray upstairs but Its not so convenient ,0
 The room was a little noisy on the Fruday night,0
 Location,0
 Rooms were small,0
 Room not ready for 2pm check in No window in room ,0
 the way hotel manger deal with me its not acceptable very very bad i have to write the written complain on her ,0
 Bacon hard and food not hot ,0
 Elevator is not really functioning well and they downgraded me from the room I paid for to tiny room and still charged me the same rate,0
 Coffee served by staff to the tables during breakfast is almost non excisting A better way of doing that is a must But a very nice breakfast The room need refurbishment nice but outdated But it s is scheduled in September ,0
 Furniture in the room partially outdated and worn off bathroom tiles could be replaced as some of them are broken ,0
 Price and small tight rooms,0
 The auto enrollment to the spg but no biggie ,0
 Staff could be more friendlier,0
 They are undergoing construction but when I had trouble sleeping in the afternoon jet lag they swiftly moved me to the top floor ,0
 Restaurant is over priced for what you actually get Also was surprised about the 10 50 service charge as we weren t aware of it ,0
 Bar prices a little less pricey ,0
 we had paid for a De Luxe room and for the most part the room was excellent however i must mention the WC It appeared that the toilet may have been removed from the bathroom to include a bath which meant there was a separate toilet which was tiny as a 2m tall man it was extremely difficult to manouevre in and out,0
 The pillows were to soft duvet to warm heavy,0
 Slow WiFi small rooms ,0
 The booking on line via agencies isn t very clear as you book a Deluxe room on the assumption that this is the best available However it isn t ,0
 Pool wasn t clean ,0
 The price of the spa that is 15 eur per person per day ,0
 The breakfast has hardly changed in 30 years except they now add dry scrambled eggs and baked beans Not good enough in such a hotel,0
 Niks,0
 Breakfast wasn t the best,0
 Parking is first serve basis only 7 spots we did not get one so had to park 5 mins walk from hotel with kids and bags and 37 Euro charge per day,0
 Could hear the Underground from room Some of the rooms can be very small ,0
 I arrived 1 30 pm and they gave me the room at 2 15 pm they were very slow and late in check in The room is very small and old furniture with poor Internet connection An advice don t go for the location itself as there is no specific center in Amsterdam ,0
 You still need to do more complementary in the rooms,0
 Room key would not for the second night the booking com process somehow made the key invalid Reception took ages to sort it out,0
 The rooms are rather little smaller than expected the shower room is open to the bedroom in a corner not so good,0
 Restaurant food very average taxi company that hotel use is overpriced Taxi we used on return journeys was less than half the price very frustrating ,0
 Noise,0
 Size of the room Smallest double room and double bed I have ever been No free wifi ,0
 The parking is too expensive 16 euros per day Geting out of the parking lot is very chalanging because there is a big slope and the door opens automaticaly but very slow so if you arrive fast in front of the exit door the car s engine dies and you slip back into a wall there is a big turn right before the exit The coffee at breakfast was awfull a 4 stars hotel should have an espresso machine It takes about 10 seconds to have the light in the bathroom It feels like forever ,0
 We stayed 4 days and they cleaned the room only once,0
 Staff is very unpleasant specially those serving breakfast with manager being quite rude to tourists Elevator broke down and had to use stairs for a day and a half until it was fixed Rooms and bathroom are tiny ,0
 They say the pool area is heated but they forget to mention the water is ICE COLD Come on people either you have a pool or you don t but this is childish ,0
 The room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night ,0
 There wasn t much choice of wine and there wasn t much choice of food Location was not the best but taxi service was available from the hotel ,0
 Too much laundry in the corridors,0
 Not specific to this hotel but wish city hotels didn t try to charge so much for breakfast ,0
 It is shabby and worn down not worthy of 4 stars almost not worthy of 3 ,0
 Breakfast room too much noisy Make you feel under pressure already on the early morning,0
 Disappointed breakfast was not included when it stated breakfast on booking,0
 WIFI connectivity in room did not really work and communication about whether it was included or not in price was unclear Breakfast is very elaborate but display is messy and with lots of children filling their plates it got more messy ,0
 Pillows not very comfortable Strange smell throughout whole hotel,0
 I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy ,0
 The thickness of the walls between rooms isn t good with noisy neighbours we had a very early start to the day ,0
 THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE HOTEL WAS A BIT NEGLECTED THE PICTURE ON THE WEB DID NOT REFLECT THE IMAGE THE STAFF TRIED TO HELP BUT SOME FEEL SHORT WHERE AS SOME WENT BEYOND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN DO AS YOU SAY ,0
 pool was small but refreshing a bit of a walk to the sites but convenient public transit,0
 check in at 3pm,0
 No electricity in our room on the morning of our last day But the staff was nice to give us a discount We very appreciate it Thank you We definitely will come back ,0
 Room a little compact hotel bar very expensive 17 for a G T and a beer ,0
 Room service burger was brought after 1 25 hours and although got a call after 30 mins telling me the chef was very busy and my ordered wine would be brought up which I wasn t burger was very good in the end in the morning I mentioned this and my email was taken so half expected some follow up so a nice hotel let down a little by the kitchen ,0
 The way they done there dinner,0
 Hard to access no help upon artivall,0
 Room size was less than expected ,0
 The photo of the room didn t match what was provided the room provided was way smaller ,0
 Bigger range of free teas and coffees,0
 The only fault there was Were the road works down the road noisy but no fault of her own ,0
 The price for the breakfast was different than what it was charged at the hotel ,0
 Wasn t given any of my genius perks,0
 Exorbitant charge for valet parking,0
 N a,0
 Lack of residents lounge,0
 We stayed for two nights one at the beginning of our cruise and one at the end The first night we informed the staff that we would only need a room for 2 people on our return after the cruise We were told that we were all set After our second night stay we were billed the full amount for three people and were told that we should have changed our reservations through the agency in which we booked and that we had to pay the full amount This was NOT a great way to end our vacation being overcharged for our room because we were not informed about the policy ,0
 Having to come home after 3 great days ,0
 There was no kettle in the room like other 4 hotels The price of breakfast a 15 was too much for the menu they had ,0
 Toilet didn t flush easily and air conditioning wasn t very good ,0
 room was cold the maximum temp is 23C but i think even less than 23C,0
 The area looks a bit rough but we had no problems Walking distance to shops and the Cathedral Milano,0
 On the whole this hotel was fabulous only thing if I had to say if anything was it was a little pricey I guess it s true you get what you pay for ,0
 View from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building ,0
 The staff forgot to send me the invoice via email as promised ,0
 The mattress was uncomfortable the doors slamming from the other rooms kept us up ,0
 I ve never stayed at a hotel with such paper thin walls When the person next door opens their door I thought they were entering my room You hear everything in and outside The noise outside goes until 1 2am The plumbing was broken and I was told it would be replaced it never was ,0
 No terrace on the roof and very long corridors because of the old building but in the same time the good quality of rooms It was value for money and located in a good place That s why it was my choice But 1 night I stayed in their second hotel which advise me in a hotel due to no availability for the first night Lond City Houses located nearby and had a little bit more quality there and good terrace on the roof for breakfast and nice city view So I can advise both of this hotels to stay ,0
 That they tried to transfer us to the Paleham Hotel which I did not like ,0
 Room a bit bigger it seemed very compact,0
 Hairdryer stopped working when it got hot Nowhere to hang hand towel in bathroom,0
 The hairdryer ,0
 Having to pay extra for WiFi,0
 lack a sport facilities limited lift capacity although walking upstairs and downstairs resolved both problem ,0
 Very very noisy place You will listen for every guest arriving even in the middle of the night We were very unlucky and on the top we ve got people upstairs which were jumping up and down or its just the place ,0
 Road noise But that s out of the hotels control Next time will pack earplugs ,0
 Not a bad experience but room was very small and no provision for placement of suitcases etc even though we upgraded to an executive room ,0
 Breakfast expensive and not included in the room rate,0
 Service could have been friendlier ,0
 I wasn t there enough to spot something i didn t like,0
 Only thing was having no bath But you can live with that because of the wet room you have with a large waterfall shower ,0
 The bolt on the bathroom door is a strange design which meant we were locked out of our bathroom at 3 am which is a rather surreal experience Housekeeping came quickly to rectify the situation Room servive is very good The size of our riverview room was excellent The appointments in the room are mainly very good but the blinds could do with an up grade Housekeeping are aware of this need ,0
 Small rooms even the club room Small toilets,0
 breakfast there was not really good,0
 The bed was so so soft and we are used to the firmest mattress at home We removed the topper and this helped on our last night ,0
 I just love everything,0
 The breakfast was cold and no sauces any where,0
 I paid for my parking walked straight to my car entered my destination into the sat nav and went to leave When I got to the barrier it would not allow me to leave It took me one minute to enter my sat nav and it charged me 2 euros extra for that time ,0
 Room a bit dark,0
 Felt the price we paid even allowing for the fact it was London the room was VERY small have stayed here before when room size was much more acceptable then Hotel was Kensington Close xx,0
 The wifi did not work for the first night ,0
 Staff were indifferent not unfriendly but not friendly either On the expensive side ,0
 There was no plug in the sink and the staff had no idea how to find one until housekeeping came in the following morning not very helpful as I had left by then ,0
 Weak water pressure in bathroom ,0
 Very very small room but expected,0
 Expensive and small bedroom but ok ,0
 Hope To have slippers ,0
 The room is too small and was not good as expected ,0
 No complaints ,0
 Overpriced for a hotel that needs updating Our room was tiny and had no air con Won t be back You pay for the location of the hotel and not the rooms ,0
 was awoken early by housekeeping even though checkout was 12 noon,0
 My boyfriend and I went to the spa at various times throughout the day and each and every time there was a sign there that said Please do not disturb Doing a massage in the back But the sign literally never moved I m convinced only one person was on shift both days or something because whomever was never at the desk I also had trouble with room service To order pizza and it took an hour of our request for an hour to be fulfilled So getting things done in a timely fashion when it comes to room service wasn t the best ,0
 We could hear the room next door Dry martini was way over priced,0
 The most ridiculous things is 12 a day for WiFi ,0
 we have gold membership however forgot to carry the physical card we had our membership nmrbr but the staff said they couldn t honour it so didn t get points or any upgrades since we didn t have the physical card this was disappointing ,0
 The rooms are a bit dated You also need to have the TV on to have access to the wifi which is a bit bizarre The hotel is almost half an hour walk from Duomo but super close to the central station and metro ,0
 Buzzing noise on and off all night,0
 Didn t have it but thought breakfast was overpriced ,0
 Breakfast could be better No bottle of water in the room,0
 the bad WIFI connection,0
 Waiters English poor but not major issue just couldn t chat with,0
 A bit chilly in the room Also no heating in the bathroom and low shower pressure Breakfast not the best But these were all minor issues the rest was perfect ,0
 A little more storage space would have been good and a hook or two in the bathroom to hang a bathrobe Also the electrical switches should be labeled somehow ,0
 You have to be mindful of the refelctions in the windows into other rooms due to the design on the glass ,0
 noise coming from the top floor Every time someone walk in the floor above we could hear in the floor below ,0
 Worst experience using Booking com Booking recommended a Deluxe King Room to me for 2 adults and 2 children however when I arrived at the hotel they told me I can t stay in that room because We have 4 people even though my little daughter is only 8 months old I have to upgrade the room to a Junior Suite and cost me 200 euros more It s a terrible experience and I contacted Booking right away but got no reply until now 12 days passed ,0
 Housekeeping,0
 cleanliness of room Bad WIFI signal no bar at 10 30 pm,0
 Daylight was showing through the curtains room a little bit small for 3 persons,0
 No fitness facilities but noticed they are opening one very soon right beside hotel ,0
 If you are unlucky to be on the right side of the hotel you are going to get an early wake up call as there is a train station outside your window A real shame as the rest of the hotel ie very good ,0
 Only one thing faucet had a separate cold and warm handle typically British nice looking but it was some kind of a battle to find the right temperature,0
 Breakfast is somewhat pricey,0
 Rooms were a bit tired Bedding acceptable but not executive level expected ,0
 Gym Prices Roof top area,0
 The rooms have everything you could wish for but are a little on he small side ,0
 Location isn t the best Far away from the city center made me feel isolated You walk and walk and don t find a soul around even during the summer Staff is alright but not exactly friendly Nobody makes an effort to make you feel welcome As a matter of fact I felt like aswering questions was a bit annoying for them ,0
 Cleaning ,0
 Wifi speed and landing page was rubbish,0
 Carpet was a little dirty but I am really nitpicking here ,0
 Had to move rooms as first room had a leak clear musty smell from wet carpet which should have been picked up by housekeeper Hit and miss with facilities in new room missing tea cups and bathroom toiletries minor things ,0
 Air con quite noisy ,0
 Very small room and very small bed better to say short If you are taller than 180 be ready that your feets will hang off out the bed The lack of sound insulation and the room is very dark and everything is pretty old The breakfast is terrible for 25 EUR very poor,0
 The bed could have been more comfy The breakfast on the Monday was not as delicious as the Sunday morning Asked for Calvados Brandy which was on the menu but it wasn t available ,0
 What I didn t like was I only got to stay at this hotel for two nights It was a pleasure staking there ,0
 The odour of hay or similar in the room for which a room diffuser with essential oils as provided ,0
 Food in restaurant could be better The chef may have forgotten to salt it ,0
 The facility overall is quite old ,0
 there was strong smell of paint and chemicals during our stay every morning at 830 the sounds of construction could be heard loudly in our rooms we called ahead to ask about the renovation and we were told that we would not hear anything as they were putting final touches such as paint and no heavy construction was being done they failed to mention that the building next door was under complete construction and the sounds of jackhammers and drills could be heard easily through the walls ,0
 Everything was great the bed could have been a little more comfortable ,0
 The room may be a little small for some people but was perfect for us ,0
 Bar was a little expensive,0
 weird staff on the breakfast saloon dark room looking at an ugly backyard,0
 Room was too hot and aircon did not seem to work properly Bar tender struggled to make cocktails ,0
 4 star hotel is a huge overstatement ,0
 Wi fi was not enough ,0
 Air conditioning was not going below 27 C and it was 32 outside Staff could not help when we found out as it was already 8 pm Not exactly what I expect in a 4 stars hotel We found a piece big one of ceramic in our scrambled eggs We immediately showed the staff and they apologized and took away the plate where we found it and left the other one nor the tray at breakfast counter I had to call them and explain that we were lucky we found a big piece and did not just swallowed it and that there may be small pieces in the eggs and those are hard to see They did remove the tray and replaced it and brought me an omelette ,0
 No breakfast included,0
 Left Shirts in room hotel policy you have to send them packaging and pre pay it ridiculous in this day and age wont go there again because of this plenty of hotels around SSE ,0
 No kitchen facilities at all ,0
 All was good,0
 Queues at breakfast,0
 I had a basement room at the front The construction of the new building opposite goes on 24 hours so very noisy I suspect this will be ok once finished The room is very small but not dissimilar to other local hotels in the city The immediate basics were clean I e slink shower furniture and bedlinen but the rest was filthy Thick dust on top of the skirting boards all the corners full of dust and debris The phone did not work and there was no extra way of locking the door so I felt a little vulnerable on my own The Bed was rock hard and I like a hard mattress normally So I had a bad nights sleep due to the hard bed and the noise and do not intend to stay there again in the foreseeable future ,0
 If you are going to charge to eat breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel you should at least provide a decent discount for the hotel guests We only ate dinner at the oa one time It wasn t bad but not worth the price It would have been nice to have the option to eat breakfast for a decent price for two people and or a family Or even a complementary coffee per adult would have been nice The parking was overpriced also ,0
 The room provided to us the hotel authority called a jr suite but it was not really a jr suite class the room furnitures and surroundings wooden false wall look quite old and used need to change The bed was not comfortable at all the room service is quite long waiting The cleanliness is not a 4 class hotel quite disappointing ,0
 Reception is small and can get busy at times There is no minibar although there is a fridge in every room Rooms are a bit small ,0
 WiFi could be better ,0
 They refused to store our luggage for a few hours when we return from a cruise ,0
 The view from the room ,0
 Rooms a bit noisy,0
 Very little indeed ,0
 Breakfast was a disappointment Breakfast staff were very rude and unprofessional The hotel doesn t feel like a 4 star You have to take your own luggage up to your room and bring it down ,0
 Billing system was very confusing and made you worry was going to cost more than booked on internet Could be less confusing Save the staff time having to explain it too ,0
 walk to the station was a bit far bath bar soap would have been a good addition to their amenities ,0
 I paid 120 to get room with A c it was tiny old room when told them Ac is not working they sent someone he came and told he can t fix it please open the window,0
 Slow wifi,0
 Price of breakfast walk up the road for better cheaper breakfast ,0
 Too expensive based on the facility ,0
 Rooms restaurant facilities cleaning and reception ,0
 The hotel locks the main door sometime after midnight one night during our stay we returned late and it took a while for the door to be opened to let us in View from the room was pretty poor but it didn t spoil our stay The air conditioner didn t cool the air just recirculated it Breakfast was pricey at 18 per head so ate out and got good value at local caf s ,0
 Rest assured I meet exceed the standards of the caliber of guest I can only assume is expected by the front desk staff my last stay in London was spent at the Savoy I don t prance about in trainers and message jerseys I felt less than up to snuff by one member of the front desk staff She should rest assured that if she interviewed for a position as a member of my staff she would walk away unhired ,0
 Booked this hotel months ago made it perfectly clear to hotel and booking com my wife has disability and in wheelchair My wife had to walk up stairs to entrance and down to depart was told there would be a makeshift ramp on arrival Should have been told hotel not suitable when booking The lady on reception read my email on arrival as she said she wasn t aware Disappointing break,0
 I went there with my family We booked the hotel with a good offer 400 euro for 3 nights 3 months in advance and informed them that we have a kid and they agreed But when we went there they charged us for 200 euro extra for my son ,0
 Not being able to open windows very hot in bedroom bathroom,0
 Room layout was odd no door on the toilet ,0
 My only complaint was a very lumpy pillow,0
 water hose next to the toilet should be there for arabs we clean water not paper towels,0
 Wi Fi could have been free ,0
 location isn t the best,0
 I liked it all ,0
 Rooms on the ground floor near dinning room just awful ,0
 some staff need to be more p olite,0
 Bed size Room was very cosy The bathroom had a glass door WS staying with my friend so wasn t ideal but even if I was staying with my partner I would still want some privacy in the bathroom ,0
 We were a little disappointed with the hotel pool We weren t expecting something recreational but the pool itself and the area were a bit small and the pool itself was quite cold We were hoping for something a little more spa sauna like It is definitely not an area meant for kids but I suppose the shallow depth would be good for younger children ,0
 Far from city,0
 Little better food snacks menu ,0
 Executive club food was awful all dried up Cold breakfast food at 7am Only Prosecco no Champagne or sparkling wine Very poor selection of alcoholic drinks felt like an airport lounge rather than an executive club ,0
 Expensively,0
 Service Water in the pool was very cold Not good value for money Menu was very limited,0
 Bar not being open,0
 ordinary Breakfast,0
 The room was awful bad carpet deliberately left crumbs on the carpet to see if they would hoover up the next day and it wasn t noisy next door bathroom small,0
 Staff Vant remember two times in a row to infor other colleges about staying more days Next day being kuckes out because they arefully booked Not even trieng to find salution arogant and rude ,0
 More variety in breakfast,0
 No control of air conditioning room very hot Had windows open for cool air and smokers from adjacent room sitting on the window sill talking loudly at 2am both nights Supposed to be nonsmoking hotel but could smell smoke throughout floors and lobby even in restaurant Bathroom nice but shower leaked and didnt drain properly Lifts old and rattly very noisy we had room next to lift ,0
 Poor room quality and dated fittings decor room not clean as you would expect for pricey hotel extra deposit not mentioned in booking or conditions very very poor,0
 My room was looking to the street and it was noisy at night ,0
 no tea or coffee,0
 The breakfast is expensive The location is fair ,0
 The air conditioner stopped working but the staff were very apologetic and gave us a fan for our room and a complimentary breakfast ,0
 Breakfast buffet was below average and very little selection Staff was not really friendly,0
 Quatari owned hotel No alcohol Arab atmosphere not English Electrical problems A C very difficult to set ,0
 There was no hot water when taking a shower It was not good as the weather was cold also ,0
 Outside noise from lorries offloading at 04 00hrs 06 00 hrs makes it difficult to sleep in our allocated room,0
 I do nt know,0
 The staff where very helpful and the hotel apart from the bed sheet was great ,0
 The bar area was nice but lacked atmosphere and the prices were very high so people didn t go in ,0
 As above with Wifi Also the receptionist who checked us in was really friendly on that day but when I saw her the following morning she ignored me when I said hello ,0
 The basin overflow was full of bacterial growth and the shower cubicle was similarly unclean These problems are only visible when cleaning teeth or having a shower The shower tiling was also showing signs of coming away directly below the shower taps I would suggest you review your monitoring methodology and instigate a periodic deep clean I wonder if you will actually act on this information ,0
 Services at the cafe and restaurant and cleaninness of the hotel and room,0
 bed too soft rooms too hot,0
 If being picky coffee tea facilities within the room would be beneficial ,0
 on Sunday afternoon we decided to have a quiet drink but the whole atmosphere was shattered by a group of children running around like banshees and with a scooter in the reception sitting area Parents didn t do anything to stop it and once the concierge came and told them to stop climbing on the furniture Not the hotels fault though,0
 Room not ready on arrival rudeness of maid staff,0
 Ants in the bedroom and bathroom No water trap in the shower meant a bad smell put a wet flannel over the drain plug in the shower to stop the smell ,0

 Broken kettle plug and light Tatty bathroom Can t charge things overnight as electricity cuts out when you switch lights off ,0
 surprised after spending 07 nights two double rooms we were ask to pay early check out fee we checked out at 6 am Breakfast only red meet or chicken based dishes were available would have preferred some sea food options well now most of us prefer fish to red meet due to health reasons specialty filleted sea bass or Modha would have been super ,0
 Sink in the bathroom was too small,0
 N A,0
 They had a lovely garden with fountains but I wish they would have had some heaters in the garden area under the tent where they had tables and chairs As it gets cold this time of year it is not possible to enjoy the greenery without proper outdoor heating ,0
 There s no tv channels enough I get a room with 3 beds instead a big one so it wasn t so comfortable We didn t had bathrobes as the first time We didnt get the breakfast,0
 I came to the breakfast room at 10 10 and was denied entrance because it was too late I was offered a plain platter to go and requested to take my breakfast elsewhere Since nowhere was stated that breakfast was only until 10 and I ordered it ahead it was quite disappointing Only a small soap in the bathroom TV jaggy almost unusable and Wifi very slow Overall this was IMO really overpriced 250 for the night with breakfast ,0
 Room great for one night but a bit small for a longer stay ,0
 small room not clean enough the downstairs room is a little bit noisy no free water provided,0

 We wouldn t class this Hotel as a 4 star Rooms were very small and cramped insufficient hanging and drawer space Shower was not up to standard and badly designed After having a shower the whole floor got soaked ,0
 Cleaness,0
 The room was small but it was well appointed with a large desk The hotel is pricey but probably not much more than any hotel in Amsterdam ,0
 we where in room 1123 ruight above the area that all the staff congregate for there breaks It was constantly noisy car alarms going off The staff where extremely loud in the evenings wasn t aware of the 100 euros deposit on arrival that was a bit of a shock and I saw others checking in who where also unaware of this 100 euro holding deposit ,0
 Location no good view,0
 central heating system is too loud all over the night,0
 Not really anything we would stay there again,0
 Not well located,0
 No hot water in the morning but think they had a problem with the boiler as there were also plug in rads in the room Was very noisy at 6am when the dustbin lorry came Also could hear every time a door in the corridor shut This this is because it is an old hotel ,0
 Breakfast could have been better,0
 bar prices and maybe a stout or guinness on tap,0
 Room was a bit tired bathroom door was lifting on the inside,0
 Breakfast The service at breakfast nobody offered coffee two days in a row The food in the restaurant was not so good ,0

 I did not realise that the breakfast was not included in the package,0
 Room size The same breakfast,0
 Hotel next to a brothel,0
 Breakfast is way too expensive 25e per person so we went out for breakfast,0
 None,0
 Most staff were wonderful and the hotel was fantastic overall However that one member of staff really did spur the taste of mecure ,0
 Noisy because of cars racing in front street,0
 I just wish we didn t have to leave ,0
 Very unstable wifi connection So troublesome to reconnect everytime we returned to the Hotel Took very long time to connect to the wifi Some dead flies insects on blanket wall of toilet and bath towel Sadly we stayed right next to the housekeeper storeroom so it was quite noisy early from 8am every morning ,0
 Only 3 TV channels rooms were too warm no air circulation if windows not open,0

 Facilities including gym sauna etc,0
 Very unreliable wifi breakfast was mediocre limited hot food especially in the executive lounge cleaning is slow extends right up to late evening ,0
 In the bathroom I had just shower gel in the big bottle no hair cap body lotion or simillar things that are usually present Location is quiet far from the center and looks a bit industrial however it s close to the tube station No safe box in the room ,0
 It does not look 4 stars compared to other 4 stars hotels I would rate it 3 or below no much facilities inside the room bathroom is very poor ,0
 The room is too small not so comfortable but clean ,0
 Carpets decor bathroom furniture all rather tired ,0
 Pillows,0
 Checking time,0
 Struggled to find nice eateries,0
 No fridge Bathroom had a weird unpleasant smell ,0
 In my view glass doors and screens to bathrooms are not good would request conventional door in future ,0
 The furniture is old,0
 The rooms we were offered on the Montague St side are small noisy with the window open stuffy with the window closed The room we changed to Bloom s Town House was quiet but too dark and there was a strange smell cleaning products These days every hotel should have unlimited free wifi not requiring repeated logins guests should not have to pay for normal unlimited wifi here called Premium ,0
 Given a poor quality room that was not the one we booked and Overcharged Several maintenance issues with room Several service mistakes by hotel and restaurant staff,0
 A bit complicated to get to this place from airport by public transport ,0
 Small hot room with dated decor No A C in public areas very hot Hotel is really a 3 star property Extra cost for wi fi which should be included at the price point ,0
 The staff were rude and unhelpful Also they only give you one bottle of water per day ever if you were two We asked for another bottle and they said no we gave you yours for today That s not how you treat your customers They don t change the bathrobes nor the bedsheets at all they only pick up the bathrobes from the floor and hang it again ,0
 As soon as you get to the hotel they take a deposit off you why i dont know The bedrooms were too warm only air con as windows were locked shut so affected my asthma The breakfast was really unorganized and we felt like we werent wanted asking for things whilst the table next to us got exellent service ,0
 A C did not work ,0
 Our room classic King size was at the back along a cold bland narrow corridor ,0
 Can t complain about anything,0
 Breakfast was expensive,0
 For several nights stay the cabinet cupboard too small to fit several jackets skirts etc See comments below regarding room size worn chair and breakfast buffet ,0
 The property is really close to a 5 lane street you and ear the police cars and ambulances sirens every 5 mins until midnight and over even with the windows fully closed The hotel has steps at the entrance and next to the lift It has some old elements like radiators lift that have not been renewed and look bad No pay per view available ,0
 No Breakfast available would like to see drinks snacks available on rooftop area ,0
 The lift was out of order and breakfast wasn t included in the price,0
 Honestly I cannot find any fault to The Chamberlain ,0
 Having to pay a 50 deposit This is the first time I have ever had to do this Why The key card for the door didn t work and took 4 more new cards before I could get into my room after the machine terminal had to be fixed Good thing I wasn t in a rush Noise Every time someone used the toilet or took a shower you could eat the water from it in the room and it was quite loud Dusty cups and kettle They were covered in dust and fluff as if they had not been used in weeks the rest of the room was clean ,0
 MMORAL Hotel is diffrent Designe and diffrent than others but for family its not good so many bad tv program and picture at hotel i really dont like it Just my idea ,0
 Our room was a little cold but it was ok with the heater air con unit set to maximum We were only staying for two nights so it wasn t a problem but I was surprised that there wasn t a wardrobe or much storage space even though we had a large room A robe would have been nice too especially at this price point We had a brunch in the restaurant which was pretty disappointing The menu and presentation looked great but the food was very forgettable ,0
 Room size for two guys travelling together Would have been better to bring the wife ,0
 air con sl noisy,0
 Were given a wheelchair adapted room which means a sink the size of a large shoe no bath and nowhere to put your toiletries Also there were no set times for closing the bar which apparently closed 2 minutes before we showed up each night with no way to serve us a beer though it was still staffed and full of customers ,0
 Very small room A wall for a view ,0
 There was no bath tub And nowhere to make an extra cup of coffee with regular milk,0
 A bit pricey but this is apparently common to Milan hotels it turns out that also in low season Breakfast could be a bit better and include ANY vegetables like tomatoes cucumbers Prices at hotel restaurant very high ,0
 Just the view but it wouldn t be a reason for us not to book again,0
 Hotel was great clean friendly staff free breakfast every morning with good selection good wifi connection nice sized room with bath fridge in room Personally loved the fact that the hotel isn t in the city centre but is literally next to a train station that you can easily get to and from the airport city Would definitely stay again ,1
 Nice welcoming and service,1
 The location is perfect if you don t have a lot of time and you want to have a look at the city centre ,1
 Location price It did not cost much more to have breakfast included Room was a reasonable size and bed was comfortable ,1
 Comphy bed upgraded to executive room with nespresso machine etc for only 24 3 nights quiet room clean 4 free waters in the fridge tho no refill and close to Hammersmith station shops and Starbucks Olympia is in walking distance too,1
 Its centrality proximity to our destination,1
 Didn t like anything about the stay if i had a chance to change or cancel it I would do it right away ,1
 Free upgrade in Executive Double room complementary daily access to the Spa area Modern design Big and cozy room Open space between bathroom and bedroom is a great concept suitable for a couple Free parking option available Easy to reach from highway ,1

 Perfect location and nice rooms,1
 Good breakfast ,1
 The hotel is ideally placed in the centre of the city close to all the main tourist sites All the staff spoke perfect English and were incredibly helpful The hotel is quite funky and a draw for younger people but we did not feel out of place as a mature couple The Lobby restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel in the city centre ,1
 My room was exceptional Quality breakfasts Excellent WIFI Thoughtful and attentive staff I loved the location and would book again in a moment I felt part of history and pampered I couldn t have enjoyed my stay more ,1
 Good location with great view over the river from bar and restaurant Useful valet parking Contemporary stylish hotel with polite helpful friendly staff ,1

 I arrived there at 4pm when they decided that my room was no longer booked and they bumped me in favor of another client I had no prior warning or email from their Mangement Someone on the reception was just trying to figure out which other hotel in paris to move me to even though I was in town for work for less than 24 hours Extremely unprofessional It s only after I became extremely agitated that they actually gave me my room which implies that there was no need for this whole story or added stress Or they did that stunt to the next client who decided to check in Just unacceptable ,1

 The night before my departure to Milan Torino wreathed in mist and drizzle wore a magical air The enchantment refused to subside as I reclaimed each cherished spot bidding the city goodbye with promises to return The five night introduction to the much undervalued terrain of Piemonte had been wonderful The train for Milano Centrale was poised to depart from Torino Porta Nuova at the dot of 07 00 am Ania had booked a taxi in my name which was to deposit me at the latter juncture from the Loger Confort The FrecciaBianca journey traversing the capital cities of Piemonte and Lombardia was smooth and efficient The bustling Milano Centrale was before the traveller within an hour and a half A taxi ride to Via Lentasio and the Best Western Ascot followed in quick succession It was to be my second stay at the property after 2014 albeit a much shorter one Check in was instant The booked double room seemed small upon first sight although very comfortable After a quick bath I brought this aspect to Graziano s attention who promised me of remedial action The very next morning I was given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite The space was vast with amenities aplenty as was the luxuriously appointed bathroom The remainder of time simply flew and I felt like a much indulged in monarch The breakfast was good as always excellent cafe lattes and cappuccinos prepared on the spot and the walking distance to the Centro Storico struck me as more manageable than before Graziano s amazingly generous gesture along with my old pal Massimo s bonhomie ensured a great return stay ,1
